  <h2 class='c002'>THE COMMON WELFARE</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c003'>IN THE WAKE OF THE FLOOD</h3>

<p class='c004'>By the end of last week, according to reports
from the Red Cross representatives in the
flood district, the relief situation was being satisfactorily
handled: and out of the chaos a careful
survey was revealing more definitely the extent
of the rehabilitation problem. This unfortunately
does not shrink in magnitude, on
the basis of later reports, as does the list of
dead. It is clear that large sums will be needed. Every
message from Red Cross agents emphasizes
the urgent necessity for continuing and
redoubling the efforts to secure funds.</p>

<p class='c005'>The New York office of the Red Cross received
a despatch at the end of the week from Ernest
P. Bicknell, national director of the Red Cross
at Columbus, which gives the most comprehensive,
summary of the situation thus far received. He
says:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have just returned from tour of flooded
towns with Governor Cox and Flood Relief
Commission. Governor and Commission have
requested Red Cross to take charge of relief
operations in Ohio and all money contributed
through governor will be expended under direction
of the Red Cross. This assures absolute
freedom from conflict of authority or confusion
in expenditure in Ohio.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The emergency relief situation in each flooded
district in Ohio is well covered. Dayton, Columbus,
Cincinnati, Piqua, Troy, Ottawa, Sidney,
Hamilton, Miamisburg, Middleton, Zanesville
and Tiffin are covered by Red Cross representatives.
Information is being rapidly accumulated
on which to base rehabilitation. Am
pushing men into other flooded towns as fast
as water subsides and we can get the men. It
has been most difficult to get reliable information;
wires are still down and transportation extremely
difficult. Further rains are impeding
progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The best information we can get indicates the
following conditions throughout state. Four
hundred sixty dead in Ohio. 4,200 homes destroyed,
estimated 40,500 people temporarily
homeless and 9,000 families, outside of Dayton,
Columbus and Cincinnati, will need rehabilitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Col. Miller, chief quartermaster, reports need
of underwear of all sorts, as well as bedding
and blankets. Some Ohio towns are just being
heard from. At least thirty cities and towns
are inundated in Ohio, twenty in Indiana and
many in Illinois, Kentucky and West Virginia.
Boundary line surrounding flooded territory
more than two thousand miles long. Situation
very serious in a number of Indiana cities. I
am going to Indianapolis tomorrow at urgent
request of Governor Ralston.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Following report from Adjutant General F. S. Dickson
of Illinois indicates gravity of situation
in that state: ‘We have a flooded territory
on the eastern side of the state along the Wabash
River and its tributaries, and another
through the heart of the middle western part of
the state along the Illinois River and its tributaries,
but the most serious situation confronting
us is along the Ohio and Mississippi, particularly
the Ohio. The entire territory from
above Mount Carmel on the Wabash down past
Cairo is either submerged or in grave danger
of being submerged. Shawneetown has been
abandoned and is now under water to the extent
of approximately twenty-five or thirty feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘On duty there are two companies of national
guard and a division of naval militia. People
driven from their homes numbering approximately
eight hundred to one thousand are in the
hills back of the city and are appealing for
shelter and food. Mounds City is making a desperate
fight and there are four companies of
national guard working on the levees. The saving
of the people is in doubt because there is no
high ground in their rear to which it is possible
for them to go, they are entirely shut off
in the rear by from fifteen to twenty-five feet
of water. Cairo is practically an island and
the water from the Ohio has driven people along
the territory I have indicated, away from their
homes and back into the hills to distances of ten
to fifteen miles. This distance is entirely covered
by water. The state is furnishing all the tentage
at its command and food supplies to every
possible point within our power. From the reliable
reports from my officers who have personally
visited these places, I would say that in
the present flooded area in southern Illinois
there are from eighteen to twenty thousand people
homeless and in dire need of food.’”</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>SMASHING THE LEASE SYSTEM IN ARKANSAS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c004'>When Governor Donaghey of Arkansas just
before Christmas turned loose 360 convicts as
one step in his effort to break up the system of
hiring out prisoners to private contractors,
nearly every editor in the country found space
for the story. But when, last month, T. J. Robinson,
the new governor, signed a bill which
finally abolished the lease system and established
in its place a state farm where prisoners are
henceforth to be worked, the news was not so
picturesque and only a few papers outside of
the state of Arkansas thought it important
enough to even publish the fact.</p>

<p class='c005'>The new law brings to an end one of the most
spectacular campaigns ever waged against the
lease system.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a> “The penitentiary was not designed
for a revengeful hell,” ex-Governor
Donaghey said the day he pardoned 360 of the
state’s convicts. This extreme measure was
taken as the last means, before his retirement,
of rousing the people of Arkansas to immediate
action. By hiring out to contractors persons
whom it is the state’s duty to protect and reform,
declared the former executive, the state was
in a way giving its sanction to cruelty and exploitation.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. See <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> for Dec. 28, 1912, page 383; also
Jan. 4, 1913, page 410.</p>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The new law replaces the former Board of
Penitentiary Commissioners, which consisted of
a number of state officials who had heavy duties
in other directions, with a new Board of Penitentiary
and Reform School Commissioners.
This board has only three members and the law
stipulates that two of these shall be experienced
farmers. They are to give their entire time to
their new duties.</p>

<p class='c005'>The law declares that this commission “shall
not hire out or lease or permit any person to
hire out or lease any of the convicts of this state
to any person or persons whomsoever.” Instead,
it shall “use and work” all convicts on a state
farm, which it is authorized to purchase. A farm
of 8,000 acres is now being used for the purpose,
and it is said that all of the prison population
can be profitably employed there the year
round.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several reasons led to the selection of farm
work for prisoners. One was that there is less
competition with free labor in farm work than
in other lines of production. Another was that
it gives the men a great deal of healthful outdoor
exercise. A third was that it will enable
many of the men after release to take up work
from which there is less chance that their prison
records will exclude them than would be the case
in many of the trades ordinarily followed in
prison factories.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>GOV. FOSS URGES THREE PRISON REFORM BILLS</h3>

<p class='c004'>Three messages on prison reform in as many
weeks were recently sent to the Massachusetts
Legislature by Governor Foss. This is an unusual
record even in these days when a growing
list of state executives are trying to rouse
their people to prison reforms. Attention has
heretofore been centered mainly on Governor
West of Oregon, whose use of the honor system
among the prisoners of that state has been
stamped by many as one of the two most notable
advances during 1912 in the treatment of the
criminal; Governor Hooper of Tennessee who
spent one night in prison to experience some
of the conditions of cell life; Governor Donaghey
of Arkansas whose sensational pardoning
of 360 convicts has just resulted in the legal
abolition of the lease system in that state; and
Governor Blease of South Carolina, known as
the “pardoning governor,” who complained
that Governor Donaghey’s release of 360 prisoners
in one day had “lain him in the shade.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Governor Foss’s last message was accompanied
by three bills. One provides for new buildings
for defective delinquents; another calls for
the appointment of an expert alienist to assist
in the proper treatment of female defective delinquents,
and the third directs the prison commission
to report upon the best method of providing
institutional accommodations for those
now in prison and state care for all convicted
felons.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first measure is designed to change the
present policy of trying to reform feeble-minded
people by the methods employed for normal
persons. It has been established in recent
years that large percentages of those convicted
for law-breaking are irresponsible mentally.
The following table showing the percentage of
mentally deficient persons in seven correctional
institutions has been published by the Russell
Sage Foundation:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c005'>Governor Foss believes, as do more and more
people, that these persons, if left at large in the
community, constitute one of our gravest social
dangers. “But neither the prison nor the asylum,”
he adds, “is adapted to their incarceration,
and they are rarely capable of reform.” He
therefore recommends that two special cottage
buildings for male patients of this type be
erected at the state farm. In these they can be
under the medical direction of the hospital for
the criminal insane. For female defectives he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>urges the erection of two or more cottages near
the present reformatory for women at Sherborn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Declaring that “the county prison has no place
in a model prison system and no logical reason
for continued existence,” Governor Foss suggests
that all such jails be taken over by the
state, “with complete disregard of the personal
interests and protests of county officials, who depend
largely for their political power and patronage
on retaining the county system intact.”
While recognizing that this perhaps can not be
done at once, the governor sees no reason why
there should not be an immediate reclassification
of prisoners, so that long-term men can be located
in one kind of institution, instead of in
three as now. Likewise those amenable to instruction
and remedial treatment he thinks
should be confined by themselves. The present
system, he says, was constructed mainly at a
time when no attempt was made at such a classification.
For these reasons he thinks new
prison accommodations must be provided.</p>

<p class='c005'>Until the county jails are taken over by the
state, Governor Foss thinks they ought to be improved.
Accordingly he is in favor of a bill
now before the legislature providing for prison
schools. This measure permits the prison commissioners
to maintain, in not more than five
houses of correction, schools for the mental and
manual instruction of prisoners. The state board
of education is directed to devise plans for the
organization and administration of these schools
and to maintain supervision over them. The
teachers and instructors are to be appointed by
the prison commissioners from civil service lists.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is declared by many persons engaged in
prison administration that this apparent division
of responsibility between the State Board of
Education and the prison commissioners is disadvantageous
to the best administration of prison
schools. It is said that while there ought to be
close co-operation between the educational and
prison authorities the actual supervision of the
schools should be in the hands of the latter.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>NEW ENGLAND CONFERENCES TO PROMOTE RURAL PROGRESS</h3>

<p class='c004'>Conferences devoted to various aspects of
rural community life were held in Boston during
the first week in March. Perhaps the most important
was that which drew together professors
from the state colleges, representatives from
the state boards of agriculture, directors of the
experiment stations and men in charge of extension
work, delegates of the state granges, and
scores of farmers throughout New England interested
in the promotion of agriculture.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was the fifth annual New England Conference
on Rural Progress. As an earnest of
its purpose to do actual constructive work along
some of the lines of rural betterment it has
heretofore talked about, it changed its name to
the New England Federation for Rural Progress.
To further this purpose, the association enlarged
its executive committee and created a working
advisory council to include representatives from
each of the New England states. The new constitution
also provides for three classes of membership:
first, state federations and state organizations;
second, local, district and county organizations;
third, individuals.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some of the more important discussions were
by H. W. Tinkham of the Rhode Island State
Grange, urging the establishment of municipal
markets; C. E. Embree, general manager of the
Farmers’ Union of Maine, describing its plan to
establish consumers’ stores in New York and
other large cities; Leonard G. Robinson of the
Jewish Agricultural and Industrial Aid Society,
telling of credit to the sum of $1,500,000 given
by the society to over 2,500 farmers in twenty-eight
states; and Kenyon L. Butterfield, president
of the Massachusetts Agricultural College,
setting forth the program to which the organization
should hold:</p>

<p class='c006'>“To secure an adequate inventory of New
England agricultural resources; to carry out educational
campaigns for the best use of every
acre of New England soil; to improve vastly
our methods of marketing farm products; to
gain a better system of rural schools and to
inaugurate a comprehensive system of public
agricultural education; to try to solve the problem
of farm labor; and to maintain upon New
England soil a class of people representing the
best of American traditions—people who have
sufficient means of wholesome recreation, who
maintain strong churches, who develop a satisfying
home life and who are content with the
work and the life of the farm.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This emphasis on the human side of the problem
characterized the entire conference. For
instance, Mr. Twitchell, after an exhaustive discussion
of the financial aspects of marketing,
proposed as the final word of his report:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Success in agriculture must be measured
not by the magnitude of the crops grown but by
the quality of the men and women developed on
the farm. The sucking power of the town has
become a serious menace to our civilization, and
only live organized effort can effect that readjustment
of industrial conditions necessary for
the stimulating of desire for mastery over rural
conditions on the part of a steadily increasing
number.... If you would make your cities
safe, strong, secure and enduring, look well to
the development of your only source of supply
of fresh blood, the country boy and girl.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The officers elected were: President, J. R.
Hills, director Vermont Agricultural Experiment
Station; vice-president, R. N. Bowen,
treasurer Rhode Island Horticultural Society;
secretary and treasurer, James A. McKebben,
Secretary Boston Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The part the church plays in country life,
particularly in recreation, in public health, and
in community advancement, was under consideration
in another conference. Ministers and
teachers told what individual churches and
schools were doing, and the general discussion
indicated a growing realization of the whole
problem as well as notable efforts to grapple
with it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The various sections of the School Garden
Club met in Horticultural Hall, while at the
Twentieth Century Club, under the joint auspices
of the Massachusetts Federation of Women’s
Clubs and the New England Home Economics
Association, a mass meeting for home
makers was held. The economic and hygienic
aspects of markets were discussed by Mrs. Julian
Health of New York, president of the Housewives’
League; Sarah Louise Arnold, dean of
Simmons College; George C. Burington, manager
of the Charles River Co-operative Society,
and others.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ST. LOUIS WINS NEW TENEMENT HOUSE LAW</h3>

<p class='c004'>St. Louis has just won an unremitting fight of
five years for a tenement house law. Though
there has during these years been much newspaper
publicity, even an “extra” once when a
public hearing ended in a riot, the final passage
has been scarcely mentioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>This law, social workers feel, marks a great
advance for St. Louis. It requires running water
on every floor of every tenement house, and
a light from sunset to sunrise in every common
hallway. Further provisions are that all halls
of every tenement house must be kept by the
owner in good repair and free from dirt, filth,
ashes, or refuse, and that the rooms must be so
maintained by the tenant. Fruit, vegetables, rags,
junk, etc., may not be stored in a tenement house.
For every tenement dwelling containing more
than eight families there must be a caretaker or
janitor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Other provisions of importance are that cellars
may never be used for living purposes and
basements only under certain restricted conditions.
Finally, no apartment nor any room of
a tenement-house shall be occupied by more persons
than will allow for each adult 500 cubic
feet of air space, and for children 350 cubic feet
each. This does not apply where the occupants
make up a single family. It is designed especially
to reduce the number of lodgers, whose
presence results in so much overcrowding and
immorality.</p>

<p class='c005'>Those who have won this battle look back
over as varied a struggle as social workers have
ever encountered. In 1905 Charlotte Rumbold
prepared for the Housing Committee of the Civic
League a report on tenement-house conditions, so
vividly written and illustrated that not only St.
Louis but many other localities were stirred and
eventually framed reform legislation. The St.
Louis bill as first drawn was changed only in a
few small details during its long career before
passage. At the beginning it was fiercely fought
by real estate men, who at one public hearing
packed the house with pleaders, mostly tenement-house
tenants, against the bill. Its defenders
encountered hissing and hooting. All the lights
were suddenly turned out, and half a riot followed.
After this the crowd surged to the
mayor’s office before it quieted down. The bill
was defeated.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shortly after the Civic League and the Real
Estate Exchange held a conference and, to every
one’s amazement, found that after all they disagreed
only in certain minor matters. The same
bill was re-introduced in 1911, but failed, owing
to contention at the eleventh hour concerning
certain legal aspects. When a new Board of
Health was organized in 1912, its program included
the passage of this bill. It was again introduced
in September, 1912, and, in spite of repeated
efforts of several legislative members to
let it sleep to death, the constant prodding by
other members brought the bill to final passage.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE SEATTLE CONFERENCE OF CHARITIES AND CORRECTION</h3>

<p class='c004'>The committee on organization has been in
many respects the keystone of the National Conference
of Charities and Correction. The executive
committee is, of course, the year-round
authority, and has as its core the former presidents
of the national body. The committee on
organization has usually been appointed after
the conference delegates are on the ground, but
to it has been entrusted a two-fold responsibility
to be mastered in a single week.</p>

<p class='c005'>The proceedings of the conference are divided
into six or seven main sections. Each section
has a committee. Several of these sections have
been more or less permanent, appearing again
and again in the make-up of succeeding conferences.
The trend, however, has been away from
such a stereotyped organization. Each year new
sections and committees have been devised to
discuss new needs—committees on public health,
on occupational standards, on probation and the
like.</p>

<p class='c005'>In other words, the temporary committee on
organization has had practically to open the
channels through which the conference of the
succeeding year was to run, an exacting and
fundamental piece of work. In addition, it has
had the nomination of officers for the new year
on its hands and all the turmoil of convention
politics has descended on this committee. The result
has been that usually a dozen of the most
active and valuable members of the conference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>have been busy from early morning until midnight
throughout the entire conference week,
some of them scarcely taking part in the real
proceedings at all.</p>

<p class='c005'>At Cleveland last year a change was made
and a by-law was passed providing that the work
of the old committee on organization be handled
by two committees, one on organization and
one on nominations, and requiring that the first
should be named by the president at least three
months in advance of meetings. Frank Tucker
of New York, president of the conference which
meets in Seattle in June, has carried the reform
a stage farther. The committee on nominations
this year will not only have to choose a president
and a slate of committee chairmen, but
must find a successor to Alexander Johnson, who
for eight years has been general secretary of
the National Conference, and has resigned to
become director of the new extension department
of the Training School for Feeble-Minded
at Vineland, N. J. Mr. Tucker has, therefore,
named committees on organization, nominations,
and time and place, in order that all three
shall have ample time for their deliberations.</p>

<p class='c005'>These three committees are given below:</p>

<h3 class='c008'>FAMILY DESERTER BROUGHT TO BOOK</h3>

<p class='c004'>Probably the first check of its kind ever received
by a charitable organization is for $755.43
reimbursed to the United Hebrew Charities from
the bank account of a deserter who was brought
to book through the action of the National Desertion
Bureau.</p>

<p class='c005'>Six years ago Elias Zepnick deserted his wife
Yetta and their eight minor children in New
York city, leaving them penniless. Their condition
was so serious that the United Hebrew
Charities gave rent, clothing and living expenses
to the unfortunate family. For two years Zepnick
kept under cover but in the latter part of
1910 he was located at St. Louis. He was defiant
and the Legal Aid Bureau, in whose hands
the case was at that time, brought proceedings
under the Child Abandonment Law. The arrest
of the offender and his extradition to New York
quickly followed.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was convicted and the court was about to
pronounce sentence when it was discovered that
the prisoner had a considerable sum of money
upon deposit in a St. Louis bank. The judge pleaded
with him to provide for his wife and his eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>little ones and held out the hope of a suspended
sentence. His refusal aroused the court and the
maximum punishment, two years at hard labor
in Sing Sing and a fine of $1,000, was meted
out to him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p>CHECK WHICH BROUGHT ONE DESERTER TO BOOK</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This did not seem to unnerve him. He made
repeated requests for release and the remission
of the fine, but when reminded that he had money
in the bank and should evidence his good will
by applying part of the funds to his family, he
became sullen and would not yield.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was one point that Zepnick apparently
overlooked. A husband and father is responsible
for the necessaries furnished to the wife and
children if he neglects to provide for them. Any
stranger may make the necessary provision and
hold the parent to account. In this case it was
the United Hebrew Charities. After consultation
with the National Desertion Bureau it was
decided to institute a civil action and attach the
money that Zepnick had in the St. Louis bank.
The necessary papers were drawn by the desertion
bureau. Then, through Bernard Greensfelder,
a St. Louis attorney, a writ of garnishment
was served upon the Commonwealth Trust
Company and the money, amounting to $790, was
attached.</p>

<p class='c005'>Notice was served by the bureau’s representative
upon Zepnick at Sing Sing Prison, and what
a change! For once he became meek and tractable.
Realizing the futility of opposition, he defaulted
and confessed judgment. On February
11, of this year final judgment was entered
against him in the sum of $790 which less court
costs left a balance of $755.43. The United States
Circuit Court of St. Louis sent a check for the
money, which was at once turned over by the
Desertion Bureau to the United Hebrew Charities.
Although the struggle lasted for five years,
some little redress has been secured and now the
Zepnick family will be able to enjoy a legitimate
gratuity. Zepnick himself, however, is still obdurate
and is believed to be in London and thus
beyond the jurisdiction of our courts.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE ITALIAN AND THE SETTLEMENT</h3>

<p class='c004'>Said an American afterward: “It was not a
man who spoke but a bewildered people.” The
speaker was Vittoria Racca, professor of political
economy at the University of Rome, and his
audience was a gathering of settlement workers
in New York to whom he endeavored to interpret
the protests of the Italian immigrant usually
heard only as a grumbling in dialect.
Professor Racca has a two years’ leave of absence
in which to study the opportunities for
his fellow country men and women in America
and the efforts that are being made in their behalf.
He purposes to write a book on the subject
when he returns.</p>

<p class='c005'>The speaker described the Italian parent in
this country calling his children to his knee and
crying in tragic amazement: “These are not like
the children we had in Italy.” Whence, he asked,
came this strange brood and how was it hatched
out under the parents’ wings? With his explanation
was bound up sane advice for many of
his listeners.</p>

<p class='c005'>More stress, said Professor Racca, should be
laid on the building up of human personality by
settlements. The buildings should not be so fine
that the Italians do not feel at home. He went
on:—</p>

<p class='c006'>“The settlements should try to learn something
about Italian customs, habits, employments,
amusements, traditions—they should feel the
spirit of the Italians and see things from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Italian’s point of view. For example, one headworker
was discouraged because she had introduced
basketry into a club of Italians and they
did not like the work. It would be a good thing
for a headworker in such a case to find out what
parents do in Italy, and in that way she might
easily find some handwork which Italians would
like to do. The Italian mother should be enlightened
as to what the settlement is doing, so
that she may understand why her daughter is
out after dark, which is quite against Italian
custom. If these suggestions were followed, the
settlement would be the center for the whole
neighborhood, and not only for the boys and
girls.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Turning to what the Italian might gain from
the land of his adoption, Professor Racca said:</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would be a good thing if the young Italian
could acquire something of the strong will of
the American and could retain something of the
geniality and taste of his Italian parents. As it
is, fathers of boys who go to settlements make
most extraordinary comments showing that they
do not at all understand what is being done at
the settlements. For instance, one says he is so
sorry that the boys spend their evenings with
those bad women there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The new life of the immigrant is sometimes a
tragedy. They must adjust themselves to a totally
different kind of economic life. Wages are
seemingly high, but the cost of living is high
also. It would be much easier for the immigrants
if, on their arrival, they had to fight Indians
than for them as now to combat the complexed
social and economic conditions of a
strange land. Amusements here are different.
In Italy after work all meet in ‘the coffee house
of misery,’ where there is little to eat or to drink,
but where there is a flow of geniality and conversation.
Here everybody stays by himself, and
all wear beautiful hats and dresses, which hide
the poverty of their lives. They are here
ashamed to show their lack of success. They
are exploited by employers, by employment
agencies, by neighbors, by the Black Hand, by
the police—by everybody with whom they have
to do. They always get the worst of the law. If
it is enforced, it is enforced against them. If
it is for their protection, it is not enforced. The
immigrant Italians feel that they are despised,
which they often are, and so they congregate in
villages, which makes matters worse, and they
learn American conditions more slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here the children learn much in the schools
and in the settlements, but much more in the
streets. In the schools they learn that the
United Stales is the greatest nation in the world,
and on the streets they learn that Italy is a
despicable nation. So they think that everything
Italian is to be thrown away. There is no family
life, so the children acquire awful habits.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Not in the school or settlement, but at home,
said Professor Racca, we learn not to steal and
lie. In Italy and Russia the home, he said, is the
center of the intellectual and moral life. Therefore
the responsibility is America’s if in America
these homes crumble and the morals of the children
crumble with them. To prevent family disruption
the adults as well as the children must
be adjusted to the new environment. This adjustment
is to be made, he declared, through the
right kind of settlement. And this is what a
social settlement should be:</p>

<p class='c006'>“It should be a small institution for all the
poor, not merely for the children. At its head
should be one boss—a man. He should be married
or a widower, and have varied experience.
He should not be a minister, for if he is of the
same religion as the people he would duplicate
the work of their minister, and if he proselytizes,
the people will run away. He should not be a
professor, because he sees through narrow academic
spectacles, and he should not be an amateur
who goes into the work for a few years.
He ought to be a practical sociologist, not necessarily
acquainted with the theories, but he should
know the facts. He should be a psychologist.
He should know America thoroughly. If he is
working for Italians he should have lived at least
two years in Italy in the very provinces from
which immigrants come. He should know dialect.
He should not think that he can learn to
know the Italian and his traditions by “doing
Italy”—by visiting museums, art collections and
churches. He should work in a narrow field and
should take the place of the priests in Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He should visit every person every day, and
in this way really be their friend, father and
brother. He should be connected with all their
organizations, so that the settlement could be
the bridge between the organizations and the
workers. If he thus knows everybody, the bad
elements would dread this headworker. He
would know that certain men were not working,
and he would know that if they were nevertheless
getting a living they are probably blackmailing.
He must know individuals so well that
he can handle each in his own way; one through
an appeal to pride, another through a command,
and so on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Some headworkers, he said, are out of town
several days a week. Social workers should not
be “out” so much at lectures and parties. They
should be at the disposal of the people of the
neighborhood at every moment of the day and
night. Educational work can be done better
through chats than through lectures. “No one’s
system of life is ever changed because he has
heard a lecture,” he said. A headworker once
made an appointment with him, he said, to explain
to him what her settlement did and to take
him around. Her telephone called her away
every few minutes, and he had to content himself
with reading a folder on the settlement’s
work.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another mistake, said Professor Racca, was
to let Italians speak at the settlement. “Southern
Italians speak marvelously before they are born,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>he said; “though what they say may mean nothing.
They always speak against America and
praise the old country. And when poor people
hear these hollow words they think this speaker
worthy to be their leader.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Professor Racca in his address expressed
the opinion that volunteer workers should be
avoided because they usually have little preparation
and the settlements cannot command them
as well as if they were paid. Not many girls, he
thought, should do social work for young men,
because young men, of southern races especially,
although they have respect for women, “do not
have enough respect to accept a woman as their
leader as confidentially as they would a man.”
For work with women and children he was of
opinion there should be a woman as headworker.
“She should be married and of mature age, so
that she may have had varied experience. If
possible, she should also be a nurse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>How hard it is for a man who has at heart
the principles of prison reform to carry them
out in an old institution that should be leveled
to the ground! J. K. Codding, warden of the
Kansas State Penitentiary, writing in his eighteenth
biennial report, expresses a wish to repair
broken men and remake defective ones
by plenty of productive labor, wise and firmly
administered discipline, proper bodily care, and
such mental and spiritual training as is possible
under the limited opportunities afforded by a
penitentiary. Prison recreations he advocates
“not solely for the purpose of giving pleasure
to the prisoners, nor as a prison fad, but for
the same reason that we give them work, discipline
and wholesome food.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But what can he do to carry out such a program
in a prison where the cells are “little
dingy, dark holes in the wall, damp, musty and
disease breeding—an absolute disgrace to Kansas”?
The prison physician echoes this complaint:</p>

<p class='c005'>“If the institution hopes to make its inmates
strive for better things in life it will have to
set a better example. Compelling a man, after
a day’s work to go into one of the little cells
now provided, and sleep on a bag of straw only
half wide enough, and almost as unyielding as
the floor, will certainly never do it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet the power of personality is felt in spite
of this. The officers are all under civil service
and selected only for fitness. The warden says
“a more courteous, prompt and efficient lot of
prison officials cannot be found in any other
penitentiary in the United States.” The prisoners
themselves respond to the wise treatment
they receive and show it “in their willingness
and ability to do the work assigned them; in their
almost uniformly kind and courteous treatment of
the officers; in the absence of any destruction of
prison property; in the few punishments and
in their general cheerfulness and obedience.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Kansas ought to give a good warden a good
prison with plenty of land about it.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>CHILD LABOR AND POVERTY</h3>

<p class='c005'>Child labor is even more a cause than an
effect of poverty. This was the point emphasized
at the ninth annual conference of the
National Child Labor Committee, which was recently
held at Jacksonville, Fla. The meeting
Was characterized by fearless and frank descriptions
of conditions in the different states and
especially in the South. Apology and defence,
based on a comparison of child labor conditions
from the sectional point of view, found no place
at the conference. Delegates from the North
and from the South vied in acknowledging the
shame of a common sin.</p>

<p class='c005'>The other distinctive note was that co-operation
among all classes of social workers is
needed to gain this reform. This note was sounded
in a strong resolution which called upon
many national organizations to supply not only
the active sympathy of their membership but
special investigations of child labor conditions
from the different points of view which these
organizations have taken in their respective
spheres of work. Mention was particularly
made of the National Education Association,
the American Medical Association, the American
Academy of Medicine, the National Association
for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, the
American Red Cross, the American Bar Association,
the General Federation of Women’s
Clubs, the National Council of Jewish Women,
the Social Service Commission of the Federation
of Churches, the Russell Sage Foundation,
the Conference of Catholic Charities, the National
Conference of Charities and Correction,
the American Association for Labor Legislation,
and the American Federation of Labor. Finally,
since the child-employing industries, while forming
only a small percentage of industrial establishments,
have brought the reproach of child
labor upon American industry itself, the National
Manufacturers’ Association was also mentioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the opening meeting four questions were
discussed: Is the immature child a proper object
of charitable relief? Shall the state pension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>widows? Shall the school support the child?
Shall charitable societies relieve family distress
by finding work for children? The last question,
so far as it was referred to at all, was
emphatically answered in the negative, as the
first was in the affirmative. The discussion
turned chiefly upon the question of mothers’ pensions
and the respective value of public relief
and private philanthropy. The sentiment of the
conference was plainly for a carefully guarded
form of mothers’ pension by the state. This,
it was felt, should be considered in relation to
other remedies such as the minimum wage, workmen’s
compensation, and the prevention of those
industrial accidents which so often deprive the
family of the chief breadwinner. It was also
felt that such pensions should be regarded from
the standpoint of justice rather than of charity,
the mother to be looked upon as rendering service
to the state as the bearer and rearer of
children.</p>

<p class='c005'>A thorough acquaintance with the recent discussions
of the problem in <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> was displayed
and there was some apprehension expressed
of the many failures through ill-considered
legislation probable before success would
be finally reached. The majority apparently believed
that pensioning mothers was not simply
a problem of relief but one comprising other
elements, as the word “pension” rightly indicates.
While it was recognized that hungry
children make poor pupils, it was felt that any
further weakening of parental responsibility for
the child by the school would be unfortunate.
The discussion along these lines included talks
by Sherman C. Kingsley of Chicago; Jean
Gordon of New Orleans; Mrs. Florence Kelley
of New York; Grace Strachan of New York;
Mrs. W. L. Murdoch of Birmingham; A. T.
Jamieson of Greenwood, S. C., president of the
South Carolina Conference of Charities; R. T.
Solensten of the Associated Charities, Jacksonville,
Fla.; Leon Schwartz of the B’nai B’rith,
Mobile, Ala.; Mary H. Newell of the Associated
Charities, Columbus, Ga., and others.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rabbi David Marx of Atlanta added a touch
of scholarly research to one session in his paper
on Ancient Standards of Child Protection.
Economic factors were discussed by Miss
Gordon, who spoke on the eight-hour day and
by Richard K. Conant, secretary of the Massachusetts
Child Labor Committee, who dealt convincingly
with the fact that the textile industry
in Massachusetts no longer depends upon child
labor in spite of the numerous plaints concerning
the ruin of the industry of the sort which
Dickens satirized in Hard Times.</p>

<p class='c005'>W. H. Swift, secretary of the North Carolina
Child Labor Committee, who had just come
from a struggle with the Legislature, vigorously
attacked the contention that mill work is better
for children than the squalor of some of the
mountain towns. He described his own childhood
in an “average mountain home” in the
South as the oldest of ten children, all of whom,
he said incidentally are now doing pretty well
in life. He told of the sacrifices by his father
for their education and said that any time
within the past twenty years, his father might
have moved to a cotton mill town and lived on
the labor of his children if he had been willing
to do so. In all probability in that case the children
would have been doomed to the common
fate of cotton factory workers, with the low
wages and hopeless outlook of an unskilled
trade. Then he said that he was the father of
three children and had lived for years next door
to the best cotton mill in North Carolina. But
if he should lose his means of livelihood and be
forced to labor with his hands, rather than put
his three young children in a cotton mill,
he would “take them back to the mountains,
build a shack by the side of a spring and plow
with a brindled steer on the barren, ivy-covered
plains of the Pick-Breeches.” His reference
was to a well-known area in North Carolina
where no one has ever been known to make a
living. Mr. Swift’s partial defeat in the legislative
fight—the abolition of night work for
children under sixteen only was secured—has
made him all the more determined to continue
the war until his state shall adequately protect
its working children from exploitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>One especially significant address was by Rev.
C. E. Weltner of Columbia, S. C. After many
years’ experience in charge of the “betterment
work” of one of the noted mills of Columbia,
Mr. Weltner said he had come to the conclusion
that a better way to spend any surplus
earnings is in adding to the pay envelope so
that the people may do a few things for themselves.
The message of the conference was carried
to many sections of the city through a series
of parlor conferences, eleven in all, held on one
of the afternoons.</p>

<p class='c005'>The principal speakers at one of the evening
meetings were John A. Kingsbury, of New York,
who spoke on the poverty caused by child labor,
and Julia C. Lathrop of the Federal Children’s
Bureau, who gave an admirable outline of the
functions of the new bureau and of its first
effort to secure birth registration laws and to
learn the causes of infant mortality. Lewis W.
Hine, social photographer, threw upon the
screen pictures of child labor conditions among
the canneries of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts,
showing children of tender ages engaged in
shucking oysters and shelling shrimp. Child
Labor and Health occupied a morning session.
Dr. W. H. Oates, state factory inspector for
Alabama, made a forcible protest as a physician
against conditions which tend to cause diseases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of the throat and lungs in the children of the
cotton mills. Mr. Brown spoke of the evils of
the night-messenger service and Dr. Lindsay
discussed improvement in child labor legislation.</p>

<p class='c005'>A successful new feature of the conference
was a meeting for children held at the Imperial
Theater. It developed into two meetings, for
the thousand children expected were doubled in
number. Children themselves gave the stories
of different child-employing industries, with the
help of the stereopticon.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the final meeting Senator Hudson, of
Florida, presided. The writer made his annual
protest against cotton mill conditions in the
South, the subject this time being Our Modern
Feudalism. Jerome Jones of Atlanta, prominent
in southern labor circles, spoke of the connection
between child labor and low wages. Mrs.
Kelley gave one of her vigorous talks on the
child breadwinner and the dependent parent.
Owen R. Lovejoy appealed for more effective
support of the cause of child labor reform by
showing how widespread the evil is, how fearful
the abuses are in many instances, and explained
that the resources at the command of
the committee, in the face of the enemies and
obstacles to be overcome, are very meager.</p>

<p class='c005'>Florida conditions and legislative problems
were discussed at an informal gathering and this
culminated in the organization of the Florida
Child Labor Committee, with Dr. John W. Stagg
of Orlando, as chairman and Marcus C. Fagg of
the Children’s Home Society, Jacksonville, as
secretary. The Florida Legislature is now in
session.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>MORALS COMMISSION AND POLICE MORALS</h3>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'>

<p class='c005'>It is as obvious in New York and Chicago
as it has been in some other cities that the effort
to secure a morals commission for city governments
is intended not only to repress and prevent
the social evil but also quite as much to
protect and improve the morals of the police,
which are corrupted under the present conditions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Indeed, this is directly stated in the Report of
the Citizens’ Committee appointed at the Cooper
Union meeting held in New York last August,
after a commanding officer of the police force
had been implicated in the murder of Rosenthal
by the “gun men”:</p>

<p class='c006'>“The corruption is so ingrained that the man
of ordinary decent character entering the force
and not possessed of extraordinary moral fiber
may easily succumb.... Such a system
makes for too many of the police an organized
school of crime.... We know that the connection
between members of the police force and
crime, or commercialized vice, is continuous,
profitable and so much a matter of course that
explicit bargains do not have to be made, both
the keeping and breaking of faith being determined
by these policemen for their own profit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our recommendations on the excise and prostitution
problems are intended to benefit the
police situation.... While improvement in
the police department will incalculably improve
the tone of the city’s morals without any change
in the statutory standards, nevertheless we have
throughout hewn to the line of police reform and
not of vice suppression.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Chicago Vice Commission came to a similar
conclusion:</p>

<p class='c006'>“In certain restricted districts the laws and
ordinances of the state and city are practically
inoperative in suppressing houses of prostitution.
Because of this condition certain public
officials have given a certain discretion to the
police department and have allowed police rules
and regulations to take the place of the laws
and ordinances of these districts. As a result
of this discretion certain members of the police
force have become corrupt, and not only failed
to strictly obey the rules and regulations in the
restricted districts themselves, but have failed
adequately to enforce the law and ordinances outside
the restricted districts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The diagnoses are alike, but the treatments
proposed in New York and Chicago differ materially.
This should be pointed out, not only to
avoid the confusion incident to designating different
measures by the same or similar terms,
but also to correct the injustice of applying objections
which are only pertinent to one measure
to defeat the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>The board of social welfare proposed for New
York and the morals commission recommended
for Chicago resemble each other in organization,
but are radically different in scope and in the
means suggested for carrying out their functions.
The members of both are to be appointed by the
mayor. In New York it is proposed that the
members shall serve seven years; in Chicago
the term recommended is but two years: and
the appointments are to be approved by the city
council. No salaries are provided in either city,
but the commissioner of health in Chicago is to
be one of the members of the commission.</p>

<p class='c005'>The function of both bodies is to deal with
vice, but the jurisdiction of the New York board
is broader and corresponds to the statutes
relating to prostitution, gambling, and liquor selling.
In Chicago the function of the commission
is restricted to the social evil. It is “to take all
legal steps necessary toward the effective suppression
of bawdy and disorderly houses, houses
of ill-fame and assignation, to protect, indict and
prosecute keepers, inmates and patrons of the
same.” This commission and a morals court are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>both aimed, by the Chicago Vice Commission, at
the “constant and persistent repression of prostitution
as the immediate method, and absolute annihilation
as the ultimate ideal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>While the morals commission is to be limited
to six clerks, attorneys and medical inspectors,
together with their helpers, and must depend
upon the courts and the regular police force to
fulfil its duties, the New York board of social
welfare would have under its direct command
secret service vice squads. These, it is provided,
are to be distinct from the constabulary forces
of the police, “so that the regular police shall no
longer be responsible for the control of the vices
and shall be left to their original function of
preserving peace and order.” The suggested bill
in New York, creating a department of public
morals, provides for a large staff of “public
morals” police, including captains, lieutenants,
sergeants, doormen, surgeons and policemen.
The number would probably be between two and
three hundred, all to be exempted from civil service
restrictions.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is against this separation of the control of
vice from the regular police force, which the
citizens’ committee felt “driven to recommend,”
that the committee of the Board of Aldermen in
the Curran report present the following objections:</p>

<p class='c006'>“The morals policemen would lose the information
which the regular police could furnish;
the contact of the regular force with vice cannot
thus be removed, as they must still enter
vicious resorts for the detection and arrest of
other criminals; friction and collusion between
the two police forces would be inevitable and
the collection of graft would not be eliminated;
the restriction of the morals police to dealing
only with vices would tend to low standards of
character among the men enlisting in this service
only; the exemption from civil service restrictions
would still further contribute to lax
discipline and demoralization; the division of responsibility
between two commissioners of police
would lessen the accountability and efficiency of
both.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In Chicago the responsibility has already been
divided by the recent ordinance reorganizing
the police force. Under this a second deputy
superintendent of police has been appointed, on
the basis of a competitive civil service examination,
which was thrown open to applicants from
other states. His qualifications and duties are
thus specified:</p>

<p class='c006'>“He shall not be a member of the active bureau
of the department, but shall have supervision
of the clerical, mechanical and inspection
bureau; and shall be charged with the care and
custody of departmental property and the distribution
of the same; the supervision of departmental
records; the inspection of the personnel
of the department and of stations, equipment
and departmental properties; the instruction
of officers and members of the department;
the ascertaining and recording of departmental
efficiency, individual and group; the receipt and
investigation of all complaints of citizens regarding
members of the police force; the supervision
of the strict enforcement of all laws and ordinances
pertaining to all matters affecting public
morals; and the censoring of moving pictures
and public performances of all kinds; the furnishing
of a card index system to all district commanders
in their respective stations, which they
shall keep to show, at all times, up to date, the
name, description, character, haunts, habits, associates
and relatives of every known person of
bad character residing in or frequenting such
district, including pick-pockets, hold-up men,
safe blowers, confidence men, vagrants, pimps,
prostitutes and people who are operating or have
operated gambling houses. All these functions
shall be performed under the direction of the
general superintendent of police.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This second bureau with its second deputy superintendent
well discriminates and divides the
clerical, inspectional and disciplinary functions
of the police department from those of the active
force. But to superimpose upon all these
well co-ordinated duties the entire responsibility
for “supervising the strict enforcement of all
laws and ordinances pertaining to all matters
affecting public morals” threatens to make impossible
either the efficient fulfilment of those
routine functions or the effective repression of
vice. Yet this measure was evidently preferred
by the city administration to the morals commission
and was substituted for it, because the
ordinance recommended by the Vice Commission
to the mayor has never been introduced in the
city council.</p>

<p class='c005'>Against the precedents and preferences of the
regular police force for the segregation and regulation
of vice, backed by the mayor’s preference
for the same policy, what can this lone
“second deputy” do to secure “the strict enforcement
of these laws and ordinances”? His appointment
and helplessness are new arguments
for a morals commission to support him both
in the enforcement of the law and in publicly
placing responsibility for its non-enforcement.</p>

<p class='c005'>The substitution of this subterfuge in lieu of
the morals commission can be explained in the
same way that Chief Justice Harry Olson, of
the Municipal Court of Chicago, accounts for the
unexpected closing of the segregated districts.
He traced the sudden change in the attitude of
county and city officials toward segregated vice
to the decision of the Circuit Court which granted
a permanent injunction restraining the use of
certain property in the segregated district for
immoral purposes. “This order of the Chancery
Court was,” he said, “the Appomattox of the
war upon openly tolerated vice in Chicago.”
For this decision served notice that any citizen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>by invoking the aid of the courts, could restrain
vice, if the public officials were unable or unwilling
to do so. “It was thus the beginning
of the end,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c005'>The morals court, he said, would further act
as a check upon the second deputy superintendent
of police, because “the records and the statistics
of the court will show the names of the
owners of such houses, together with their proprietors,
inmates and frequenters, and will disclose
the business of the promoters of the traffic
and others who may profit therefrom.” So if
this feature of the reorganized police department
was intended by the city administration to effect
its escape from the morals commission as one
horn of the dilemma presented by the Vice Commission,
Justice Olson clearly shows that the
morals courts is the other horn. Neither the
police of the city administration, nor the state’s
attorney of the county, can escape if citizens
seek warrants from the morals court or injunctions
from the Circuit Court.</p>

<p class='c005'>The inquiry into the relation of low wages to
the demoralization of young girls and women,
and the propaganda to correct this tendency by
minimum wage laws will bear close watching.
It may not only injure the broader movement to
secure minimum wage laws based upon just and
safe economic grounds, but it may also divert
attention from the enactment and enforcement
of laws against commercialized vice. For the ensnaring
of victims is accomplished through many
more devious ways than can be charged up to
low wages.</p>

<p class='c005'>In all our large cities thousands of young
people, weary from their monotonous work in
shop or factory, seek the streets in the evening
imperiously asserting their right to pleasure.
Business enterprise has taken advantage of this
natural desire for recreation, and commercialized
amusements have sprung up on all sides ready
to cater to every taste of this childish multitude.
Penny arcades, slot machines, moving picture
shows, cheap theaters, amusements parks and
dance halls are all attempting to lure children
with every device known to modern advertising.
Young people are thus without protection and
exposed to temptation at the very moment when
they are least able to withstand it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many students of municipal affairs believe
that every large city should have morals police,
of whom a certain number should be women, if
it would properly protect young girls for whose
unwary feet so many pitfalls are spread, and if
it would deal adequately with prostitution—that
grave menace to health and morals.</p>

<p class='c005'>We need women police in the theaters of
every city to watch the girls who attend these
entertainments and accept the invitations of
young men offered with disreputable intentions.
In the majority of cheap theaters the moving
pictures are shown in a dim light and the danger
to young people has been shifted from the stage
to the auditorium. The darkened room affords
opportunity for familiarity, and there should be
women police to see that conventionalities and
decencies are observed.</p>

<p class='c005'>There should be women police in our dance
halls—the happy hunting ground of the white
slave trader—to watch the girls and also the
boys, to warn the girls when they are seen taking
too much liquor and to watch that if intoxicated
they are not accompanied from the hall
by young men who have plied them with liquor
for illicit purposes. They should also see that
young unsophisticated boys are not victimized by
professional prostitutes who take advantage of
inexperienced youths who come to the city for
the first time and visit the dance halls to “see
the sights.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Women police should be stationed on pleasure
boats and at bathing beaches and should
ever be on the alert for conditions which demoralize
children. We need women police in
our amusement parks to mingle with the crowds
at the gates and to save young girls from accepting
invitations from men who hope to be
repaid later in the evening. We need women
police in such places to follow girls who are
seen going to lonely parts of the parks accompanied
by young men. In fact, we need women
police to “mother” the girls in all public places
where the danger to young people is great.</p>

<p class='c005'>In our station houses we should have women
police in whose charge girls should be placed.
Women police could accompany the girls to
trial and be with them when they are subjected
to harassing questions so often put to
them by attorneys, and women police should accompany
girls to the institutions to which they
are committed by the court. The work of the
woman police officer would not be very different
from that of the woman probation officer. The
Juvenile Court officers investigate homes
and neighborhoods, watch their wards to see
that they attend school or are at work, and take
charge of children after they have become delinquent.
It would be only one more step, but
one urgently needed, to have women police who
would lessen the work of the probation officers
by carefully watching for those causes which
lead children into the courts, by reporting these
conditions to the proper authorities and by carefully
supervising all places of amusement.</p>

<p class='c005'>Women truant officers attached to the compulsory
education department, the women adult
probation officers connected with the municipal
courts, the women factory inspectors, the women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>sanitary inspectors of the health department, the
women school nurses, the women supplied by the
Travelers’ Aid Association, the officers of the
Juvenile Protective Association and all other
officers paid by private organizations are doing
valiant work for the young people of our cities.
But we especially need the police power which
the city might vest in women trained for the
work and which would give them the necessary
authority to cope with certain dangerous
situations with which private organizations have
tried in vain to deal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Women police are not needed to handle
crowds, to regulate street traffic, to arrest
drunkards and criminals, but they are sorely
needed in order that they may adequately protect
the thousands of children and young people
who every day are exposed to the dangers
of unsupervised and disreputable places of
amusement and for whose safety and welfare
the city is responsible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How long, O Lord, how long!” is the cry one
is moved to utter when considering the war
mania of our time and the ever-growing burden
of armaments which this delirium is forcing
upon the world. The Balkans swept from end
to end with the scourge of “fire and sword,”
Italy fattening upon the unholy spoils wrested
from effete Turkey, Russia recreating the armies
and navies annihilated by Japan, Germany increasing
her military forces to hitherto unheard of
proportions, France answering her neighbor’s
challenge by raising her enlistment period
for citizens from two to three years, England
insisting on a five-Dreadnoughts-a-year basis,
and her colonies building ships for the imperial
navy! What a spectacle! And Jesus Christ
dead two thousand years ago!</p>

<p class='c005'>Here in America, there is a cheering sign in
the refusal of the Democratic Congress, through
two successive terms, to provide for the construction
of more than a single battleship. But
this was more than counterbalanced by the defeat
of ex-President Taft’s arbitration treaties,
the fortification of the Panama Canal, and the
movement to place the militia of the various
states in the pay of the federal government!</p>

<p class='c005'>In the face of these facts, one is tempted to
ask if there is not something the matter with
the organized peace movement, that it makes
so little headway against the onsweeping flood
of frenzied militarism. The movement has ample
brains and sufficient money: it is active, intelligent,
resourceful. But has it the passion of a
great ideal—does it really mean business—has
it got “guts,” to use the fine old Anglo-Saxon
phrase, as well as “gray-matter?”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is on this point, the most essential of all,
that one begins to have doubts and fears. Why
are there so many vice-presidents of peace societies
who are supporters of the big navy policy—why
so many advocates of peace who are
enthusiastic preparers for war—why so many
disciples of good will who believe in peace in the
abstract but in battleships in the concrete? Above
all, if the peace societies are really in earnest,
why are they so slow in joining hands and hearts
with the vast hosts of labor throughout the
world—the unionists, Socialists, syndicalists, and
all the rest, who constitute at this moment the
one really serious menace to the supremacy of
the war lords?</p>

<p class='c005'>It is here, to my mind, in this last query, that
we find the real weakness of the organized peace
movement. This movement is too academic, too
aristocratic, too exclusive. It is too much confined
to earnest scholars who deal in theories,
and amiable social leaders who deal in fads. It
holds too many dinners at $10 a plate, conducts
too many meetings in luxurious parlors and
salons, and puts its privileges of membership
and co-operation at too high a price of refinement,
culture and material wealth. There is too
much “function” and not enough “crusade!” Too
much library dust, midnight oil, pink tea, after-dinner
speaking, and not enough sweat and tears
and blood. Bankers, lawyers, clergymen, college
professors, club women—these are all right and
we need them every one. But they can never
in the world accomplish their aim alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is the common people—peasants, artisans,
factory workers—who pay the price of war and
it is only through the organized revolt of these
people that the curse of militarism can be destroyed.
Here, in “the multitudes,” whom Jesus
sought out with so true an instinct, do we find
the hope of future peace upon earth. No movement
which ignores this factor in the situation
can be regarded either as efficient or genuinely
in earnest. Sincere it may be, I grant you, but
sincere in that narrow, unsympathetic, petty way
which has blasted many a precious hope and destroyed
many a noble cause! It is time for the
peace movement to democratize itself, to work
from the bottom up and not from the top down,
to organize, inspire, co-operate with the workers
in their rebellion against militarism. This
done, something will happen in the world of
armies and navies, and happen quick! But not
before!</p>

<p class='c005'>And is it not here that the social worker may
count for much? No one hates or should hate
war more bitterly. No one sympathizes with the
organized peace societies more deeply. No one
understands the common people more truly. Is
it not time for him to act?</p>

<h3 class='c003'>MODERN PROBLEMS</h3>

<p class='c004'>By Sir Oliver Lodge. George H. Doran Co. 348 pp.
Price $2.00; by mail of <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> $2.13.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Oliver Lodge is a scientist with a worldwide
reputation, whose opinions on the structure
of atoms, on X-rays or on Hertzian waves
command instant attention. But when he expounds
such remote and multifarious subjects
as “free will and determinism,” “Bergson’s
philosophy,” “universal arbitration,” “the production
and sale of drink,” “the functions of
money,” “charity organization” and a score of
others, he rouses the suspicions of the wary.
“Nobody could possibly be as wise as Daniel
Webster looked,” and nobody could possibly be
as wise as an authoritative knowledge of these
topics implies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet the learned knight has acquitted himself
creditably. The essays are random papers, addresses
at commencement exercises and the like,
as good as such occasions warranted, though
hardly, in some cases, worth the dignity of permanent
print.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Oliver Lodge, despite his rise to the presidency
of Birmingham University, has escaped
the commonest of British diseases—snobbery.
His eyes are not blinded, by fatty layers of prosperity,
to the misery that stalks about the country.
He is not elated at the sight of those piles
of iron and slag, those miles of furnaces and
factories, those leagues of rabbit-hutch cottages,
which stretch, northwest of Birmingham, a
“Black Country” that even Satan might disown,
the heart of manufacturing England,
a blasted region where no blade of grass is
green and no life can be clean and elevated.</p>

<p class='c005'>The author is saturated with the feeling and
teaching of Ruskin, in whom these blighted
acres, and other fair districts which Mammom
had despoiled, raised such righteous tempests
of wrath. It is refreshing to find in high places
the gospel of Ruskin, that half-forgotten prophet
of social righteousness, re-stated with conviction
and re-applied to fresh problems.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Oliver is grateful to the organized charity
workers who “immerse themselves in this
mass of misery and incipient or threatening
degradation, in hope that they may raise individuals
out of it”; but, with more pleasure, he
pleads for that statesmanship which will root
out the causes of wretchedness. He must be a
whole-hearted supporter of Lloyd-George’s
schemes of social insurance, old-age pensions,
taxation of land values and better education.
With tax-payers’ associations he is surely unpopular,
for he actually denounces thrift in government
and advocates spending more and ever
more on public undertakings. He laments that
a surplus in the national revenue is made the
excuse for lowering taxes, while there are a
thousand good objects on which the surplus
could be spent. Perhaps that argument is the
easier because, like the great majority, he owns
not a foot of soil in what is euphemistically
styled “his” country. Were he in America he
would appear before boards of estimate and
the like and plead for more money for schools,
playgrounds, hospitals, and health work.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes his economics are disputable, as
when he asserts that “human labor is the ultimate
standard of value, and coins might instructively
be inscribed in terms of labor.” Even
the Marxian Socialists are shy today about defending
their prophet’s theory of labor value.
But slips like that are inevitable where so wide
a range of topics is attacked. Altogether the
volume can be recommended to those numerous
casual readers who like a little of everything
and not much of anything.</p>

<p class='c005'>The distinctive notes in Dr. Charles F. Dole’s
The Burden of Poverty are two—the new consciousness
of the spiritual nature of man whereby
poverty becomes a problem and the spiritual
urgency to meet it due to the mighty idealism
of religion. Whether conscious of a religious
motive or not, or even in conscious reaction from
something repellent in some religious concept,
all to whom poverty is a problem and who are
urged thereby to sacrifice for others are said to
be moved at both points by a religious motive.</p>

<p class='c005'>The extent and causes of poverty are accounted
for in largest part by industrial conditions,
the economic burdens of land, rent and
interest, immigration, drink and war. But to
whatever factors the problem is due it can be
met only as man becomes more religious, which
the author makes equivalent to being more
human and more civilized. Socialism rises above
its “difficulties”, if at all, only as it becomes so
human as to be “a form of the religion of pity
and sympathy.” It fails most “in not understanding
the spiritual implication of democracy,
because a materialistic democracy is impossible.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Keeping well “this side of socialism” and claiming
something better than it, Dr. Dole presents
a platform for social progress which he thinks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>appeals to a larger consensus of judgment and
synthesis of action. It summons all to end war,
intemperance, tuberculosis, and occupational and
vice diseases; to educate for responsibility and
efficiency; to redress industrial injury and injustice;
to abolish special privileges, double
standards and discriminations against sex or
class.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aside from general dependence upon moral
and religious forces to bring these things about,
the specific means of so doing are suggested under
the title, The Control of the Land—A Dream.
By the public possession or control of the land
and by taxing out of existence all inheritance
above $500,000, the way is open for the dream
of the endowment of every one at the age of
majority with inalienable possession free from
tax and rent, the assurance of employment and
provision for old age. But all depends, at last
as at first, upon our anchor to the “new” question,
“Can you convert brains to go in the way
of religion?” This is said to be the biggest problem
of religion, as it is the newest, for “it is
only lately that man has been able even to formulate
the true significance of religion in terms
at once rational for the intellect and practical
for the conduct of the daily life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“People will be happy as fast as they learn
to face these questions and to say <i>yes</i> to them.
Only men of good will really know what they
want in this world; can meet and make and control
conditions in life; can handle successfully
the new and tremendous powers of nature and
science. Only they can establish thorough democracy.
Only their ideas can preserve the nations
from the worst of all poverty—starvation
of the soul, from the worst of all tyranny—the
fear of man.”</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>In his Kingdom of God and American Life
Bishop Brewster seeks to adjust the Christian
ideal and ethic with the earlier idealism and
standards of American democracy. He identifies
them at the very points at which both are
at a crisis—liberty, justice, opportunity, loyalty,
law, civic courage, the value of human life and
the sanctity of the family. Differentiating between
“the kingdom of God” which consists in
part of such values, and the church whose witness
to these ideals is needed alike by religion
and democracy, he denies that Christianity is
either individualistic or socialistic. “The social
character it is impossible to overestimate, because
there the social never gets away from
the personal.” From this vantage he repudiates
individualism since “Christianity while never
individualistic is always personal”; and he disputes
socialism since “in nature and purpose
that scheme is economic” and “the church is
spiritual and personal”, socialism “aims at the
economic transformation of environment” and
“the church’s aim is the spiritual transformation
of the persons that make up society”, “socialism
aims at reconstruction through revolution” and
“the church at progressive reform through evolution.”</p>

<p class='c005'>While the author’s readiness to stand for the
consequences of democracy leads him to claim
that “this diversity in aim and operation does
not necessitate antagonism in spirit”, yet his
work would have been more positively and practically
effective if it had been less of an argumentative
special pleading against socialism and
more constructively aimed to build up American
democratic institutions. Pointing his emphasis
upon the essential value of democracy with the
most concrete arguments from our industrial and
civic life, his reasoning rings true to this fundamental
keynote of Christianity all the way
through from preface to conclusion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If it be true that Christianity in principle
means not individualism but solidarity; if Christianity,
while not ignoring personality, yet has,
as its ideal, personality fulfilled in social relations;
then, in a time like this, of transition,
from individualistic principles and ideals, the
church of Christ has plainly before it a task in
the world. It is no time to yield to that old
besetting temptation to hold aloof from contact
with the world. The sociological trend of
thought and life today is a realization of essential
characteristics of Christianity and makes
rightful demands upon Christians. Certainly the
church is to refrain from seeking to allay the
restlessness and fever of social discontent by
administering any anodynes that superinduce social
lethargy. Its plain task is to heal, tone up
and invigorate the social system, to quicken and
guide those social promptings and aspirations,
and make men know assuredly that Democracy
means the wider opportunity and the larger obligation
with respect to social service. It should
be evident beyond question that the church is
bringing the spirit of Jesus Christ to the ferment
of social discontent and strife. That would
require that it be itself thoroughly possessed by
that spirit. The problem that immediately confronts
the church is not to Christianize socialism,
but first to socialize Christians, until their ideal
principles shall be real and ruling principles,
until they obey the rule of principle and not contentedly
rest in sentiment.”</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>What the boy does for the minister is as well
emphasized in Professor Hoben’s suggestive little
volume The Minister and the Boy, as what
the minister may do for the boy. Basing his
whole discussion upon a frank acceptance of the
biological order and psychological development
of boy life, Professor Hoben in a scholarly, yet
very practical way, turns our newest knowledge
and experience in dealing with boys to the right
and feasible use of the ministers and church
workers. Not the least valuable parts of the
book are those which account for some of the
defects and defaults of the boy, characteristic
of certain periods of his development, on grounds
which reasonably explain them and suggest ways
of counteracting and correcting them. Self-knowledge
and control are shown as failing to
keep pace with the sense impressions and unorganized
experiences of adolescence. The
psychological analogy between play and worship
is another interesting and original point developed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The instincts rooted in the sense of
solidarity are treated as the basis of training
for the family and communal relationships and
responsibilities.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Self-centering the experience of the boy
short-circuits the religious life.” “Sex instruction
should anticipate sex consciousness.” “The
normal boy will not deliberately choose to sponge
upon the world. He intends to do the fair thing
and to amount to something. He dreams of
making his life an actual contribution to the
welfare and glory of humanity. When it is put
before him rightly he will scorn a selfish misappropriation
of his life and will enter the crusade
for the city that hath foundations whose
builder and maker is God.”</p>

<p class='c005'>These sentences indicate the author’s abiding
faith in boyhood and his epigrammatic, suggestive
style. At the end of each chapter that deals
with the more fundamental principles their most
practical applications are given. Whole chapters
are devoted to practical suggestions on such
topics as The Boy in Village and Country; The
Modern City and the Normal Boy; The Ethical
Value of Organized Play; The Boy’s Choice of a
Vocation; Training for Citizenship; The Church
Boys’ Club. References to readily accessible
books also add to the value of the volume.</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>The best supplement to Professor Hoben’s
book is the interesting and useful handbook entitled
Boy Life and Self-Government, which
Professor George Walter Fiske of Oberlin Theological
Seminary prepared for the International
Committee of Young Men’s Christian Associations,
for the use of those in charge of their
boys’ departments and other boys’ club workers.
With these two small volumes in hand and in
use, the work of every church and minister for
the boys of their parish and community cannot
fail to be more effective.</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>As a fresh, original and well-balanced study
of the boy, inspired by unusual insight and large
experience, Kirtley’s That Boy of Yours is
valuable for teachers, social workers, and above
all for parents, to whom by its title it is addressed.</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>Thwing’s The Family has been for a generation
so exclusively the one book combining for
the general reader historical and social data,
scholarly and practical purpose, that this revised
and enlarged edition renders a public service.
Unlike the more technical manuals on the family
it takes for granted no special acquaintanceship
with the history and literature of the subject,
though it is introductory to and interpretative
of both. The additional material includes
the statistical and bibliographical data appearing
since the first edition was published, and a new
concluding chapter, significantly bearing the title,
The Family Under a Socialized Society.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE TEACHER’S HEALTH</h3>

<p class='c017'>By <span class='sc'>Lewis M. Terman</span>. Houghton, Mifflin Co. 136 pp.
Price $.60; by mail of <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> $.66.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Teaching as a Dangerous Trade” might have
been the title of this book. Eighty-four per cent
of 159 teachers in Springfield, Mass., testified
that in their opinion the teacher of average
physical constitution suffers distinct impairment
of health within five to ten years after beginning
service. Between 1906 and 1909 over a quarter
of the elementary teachers of Sweden were absent
one year or more on account of illness.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it is not as a matter of mere personal concern
to the profession that the teacher’s health
is here considered; rather as a factor in school
efficiency. Medical inspection of schools is partial
so long as it takes no notice of teachers, for
“the health of the child is intricately related to
that of its teacher.” There is a subtler way in
which weak lungs and neurasthenia among the
half million teachers who are molding the intellect
and character of twenty million children in
this country may affect the development of those
children. As the editor’s introduction puts it:
“If the teacher’s conscious pedagogical method
transmits truth, it is the unconscious influence
of his personality that gives it that bias of meaning
which the fact will forever after have for
the pupil.” And nowadays we are coming to
know how much personality is shaped by physical
and mental health.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF MENTAL DEFECTIVES</h3>

<p class='c017'>By <span class='sc'>J. E. Wallace Wallin</span>, Ph. D. Warwick and York,
Inc., Baltimore. 155 pp. Price $1.25; by mail of <span class='sc'>The</span>
<span class='sc'>Survey</span> $1.32.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is one of the educational psychology
monographs edited by Guy Montrose Whipple.
The book consists of the results of a series of
tests made upon the epileptics at Skillman Village,
N. J., by the Binet-Simon scale and by some
other tests which are designed to supplement the
Binet.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Binet-Simon test is the nearest approach
to a scientific and accurate scale for measuring
intelligence that has yet been devised. It is now
being used extensively in many parts of the
world, particularly in the United States. The
work of Dr. Wallin with the epileptics at Skillman
is of value in several directions, not the
least being its value in testing the Binet scale
itself, which has been used repeatedly, at intervals
of a year, upon the inmates of the Vineland
school, with results which show remarkable
accuracy.</p>

<p class='c005'>It will be readily seen that an accurate test
of feeble-mindedness which can be applied by
a careful and intelligent observer who has not
been specially trained in psychology would be of
the greatest possible value. Realizing as we do
the absolute necessity of segregating, or in some
way controlling, the feeble-minded of every
class, the question of how to tell who is feeble-minded
is one that is continually recurring.</p>

<p class='c005'>The scale has been tested quite widely both
on normal and defective children, the most important
test on normals being that of Goddard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>who tried it on nearly 2,000 public school children.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Wallin found at Skillman that either the
Binet scale was not accurate or else that the
conditions surrounding epilepsy make the scale
less applicable to that class than to normals or
feeble-minded. This observation confirms similar
facts disclosed at Vineland and elsewhere in
connection with epilepsy and insanity; that is to
say, both of these conditions produce eccentricities
which the scale does not exactly meet.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the Binet scale is an extremely useful
device and one which will be more used, it is
only reasonable to suppose that it will be modified,
in the future, as it has been in the past,
by Goddard and others. But no matter how
carefully modified, it is not claimed to be, and
will not be claimed to be, an all-sufficient test
on such questions as sterilization, final segregation
and other very important things. Physical
tests of various kinds will also be used.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Wallin’s book concludes with a copy of
the Binet scale with directions for its use, all
of which are very valuable. On the whole the
book is a distinct contribution to the literature
of the subject and it is to be hoped that the
author’s example in testing out large numbers of
abnormals of different kinds and then publishing
the results will be followed. We know qualitatively
a great deal about the feeble-minded and
epileptic, but our quantitative knowledge is still
far from complete.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>PATHFINDERS IN MEDICINE</h3>

<p class='c017'>By <span class='sc'>Victor Robinson</span>. Medical Review of Reviews.
317 pp. Price $2.50; by mail of <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> $2.67.</p>

<p class='c005'>This book contains a series of papers most
of which have already appeared in the <cite>Medical
Review of Reviews</cite>, the <cite>Medical Record</cite>, and
other magazines. It is dedicated to Ernst
Haeckel. Dr. Abraham Jacobi wrote the preface.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Pathfinders include famous men whose
names are familiar to every one, such as Galen,
Paracelsus, Servetus, Paré, Hunter, Jenner and
Darwin, and also some who are only vaguely
known to most of us. Among these are Aretaeus,
Scheele, Laennec, Semmelweiss. We are not
told what prompted the selection of these particular
Pathfinders, or why such names as Boerhaave,
Sydenham, Pasteur and Virchow were
omitted, but one cannot demand that such a
book be all-inclusive.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Robinson has lived with the characters
of whom he writes until he has formed a
vivid picture of the personality of each, a picture
he manages to convey to his audience with
great success. Naturally it is the earlier Pathfinders
who are most interesting to the ordinary
reader and the chapter on Galen holds many
surprises for those who have been accustomed
to think of the medical skill of the ancients very
much as we think of Chinese medicine of today.
Galen knew that consumption was communicable,
and his disquisitions on dietetics and hygiene
are almost incredibly modern.</p>

<p class='c005'>The chapter on Paracelsus is especially vivid
and delightful, while the description of Aretaeus,
“the forgotten physician” gives us a picture of a
man full of insight and sympathy. Of the later
chapters the most interesting are the one on the
many-sided Hunter and that which tells of the
heroic and tragic struggle of Semmelweiss
against the blind conservatism of his own profession.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the course of one chapter Mr. Robinson
remarks that “all writing is autobiographical”
and that “prejudices&#160;... will become apparent,&#160;... where you least expect.” This is
true of his own book. No one can read a chapter
without discovering the author’s antipathy
to the Christian religion, and the monarchical
system of government. This prejudice against
what he regards as superstition and sycophancy,
leads him into some extreme statements and mars
to a certain extent what would otherwise be
delightful reading. If Calvin had been nothing
more than the man Mr. Robinson describes, he
could hardly have held sway over the minds of
several generations as he did. Mr. Robinson
will also find that the Bretons opposed the French
Revolution not from blind devotion to monarchical
tyrants, but because it meant the breakdown
of a system of local self-government and common
lands to which their Celtic natures clung.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>CIVICS FOR FOREIGNERS</h3>

<p class='c017'>By <span class='sc'>Anna A. Plass</span>, Teacher of English to Foreigners.
Rochester, N. Y. D. C. Heath &#38; Company. 186 pp.
Price $.50;  by mail of <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> $.57.</p>

<p class='c005'>To meet the demand for a book of simple
lessons for foreigners which, while aiding them
to learn English, should at the same time give
information concerning the principles of our government,
has been the aim of the author. A
very limited vocabulary has been used in presenting
the subject. Topics have been limited
for the most part to a single page, so that each
subject may be treated in as concise a manner
as possible. This also makes the book more
adaptable for pupils whose attendance is likely
to be irregular. The volume, which is well illustrated,
gives the elementary facts about the
different city departments and officials, about the
state government and state law makers, the
courts and the national government. Occasionally
realistic and practical lessons are included
such as a telephone call for the doctor and a
petition for naturalization.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the close of the book is a vocabulary in
Italian, German, Swedish, Polish, French, Greek
and Yiddish.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ANNUAL REPORT ENGLISH PRISON COMMISSION</h3>

<p class='c017'>For the year ending March 31, 1912. Wyman &#38; Sons,
32 Abingdon St., S. W., London. Price 8d.</p>

<p class='c005'>Partly because English prison and crime statistics
are better and more centralized than ours
the annual reports of the English Prison Commission
are always well worth reading. In the
year ending March 31, 1912, the proportion of
persons committed to prisons in England was
the lowest within statistical record, 439.2 per
100,000 of the population of England and Wales.
The commitments for serious crimes particularly
show a decrease. The bane of the English prison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>system is still the short sentence for misdemeanants,
81 per cent of all prisoners having
been sentenced for one month or less. Over 50
per cent of those committed to prison are sent
in default of paying a fine. This is considered
by the Prison Commission one of the most urgent
social problems demanding the attention of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c005'>The commission still regrets that the committing
magistrates do not take advantage of the
chance to classify prisoners when sentencing
them. The Borstal Institution (the English
Elmira) continues to satisfy; it has now a population
of over 400. The Borstal Association,
a released prisoner’s aid society for Borstal, has
placed 250 out of 270 lads received. Of these
about seventy-five out of one hundred cases turn
out well. The “Borstal girl” from the girl’s
reformatory has proved satisfactory in conduct
after prison in twenty-nine out of fifty-four
cases.</p>

<p class='c005'>An interesting feature is the development of
a modified Borstal (or reformatory) system in
the local prisons for the younger prisoners, just
as though in New York state we introduced
into the county jails and penitentiaries a modified
Elmira system. The problem of payment
to prisoners is engaging the commission.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Preventive Detention Prison on the Isle
of Wight had been running but a few months
when the report was prepared. Little can be
said about it as yet. The idea is not novel, but
“advanced.” Following the serving of a sentence
for a specific crime, the more professional
or habitual criminal may be sentenced to from
five to ten years of subsequent preventive detention
in a prison with privileges of limited
association with other prisoners: in short, a custodial
treatment of the criminal who is dangerous
to society because of his profession or his nature.
Many other interesting features are dealt
with in this report of Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise
and his colleagues; much that our American
prison boards and wardens cannot afford to
miss.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>SOCIAL PROGRESS IN CONTEMPORARY EUROPE</h3>

<p class='c017'>By <span class='sc'>Frederick A. Ogg</span>. The Macmillan Company. 384
pp. Price $1.50; by mail of <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> $1.61.</p>

<p class='c005'>Admission to American Trade Unions is
a retrospective study brought up to the present
of the methods by which American trade unions
control the number and quality of their membership,
through their regulations in regard to apprenticeship,
competency, admission of women,
aliens and Negroes, and the expulsion of members.
The conclusions which the writer draws
from his study are colorless, but the book presents
a wealth of facts, particularly in the footnote
references and quotations from primary
sources.</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>Professor Ogg’s review of the movements,
which almost within the memory of men
now living have transformed the social aspect
of Europe, is not profound nor original and
does not undertake to interpret these movements.
It is, however, a useful reference book of facts,
the more so since the author supplements his short
accounts of the various movements by bibliographies
of the matter covered in each chapter.
The subject matter, which is carried practically
up-to-date, covers political and industrial changes,
the condition of the agricultural population and
of the wage-earner, labor organization and politics,
and the efforts of governments to improve
the condition of the lower classes.</p>

to reduce the cost of production by making
labor more efficient. Avoid strikes, settle differences
by arbitration. If existing arbitration tribunals
are inadequate, provide better, and remember
that the real interests of labor and capital
are identical. Labor would be fruitless,
without factories and machinery. The men who
invent or provide these are entitled to their
share.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>PLAY CENTERS FOR THE POOR</h3>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>To the Editor</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Henry De Peyster’s article on Play Centers
for the Poor in <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> for March 22 is interesting
and illuminating. Evidently he has
made a profound study of the question. But with
regard to France I should like to add a few
words to correct a false impression which
Mr. De Peyster surely had no intention of giving.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he says, the problem is different in
France and Germany from that in other countries;
but he does not mention (except tacitly
by the picture on page 856) the admirable provision
made by the <cite>Mission Populaire</cite> (the McAll
Mission) to meet the actual condition.</p>

<p class='c005'>In all the larger stations of that mission both
in Paris and in the provinces (Rouen, Nantes,
Lille, etc.) the daily <cite>Ecole de Garde</cite> (supervised
study and play hours) is an important feature.
The children leave school at four—their parents
reach home from work not much before half
past six. Therefore the boys and girls within
walking distance hasten to the McAll station.
After a light lunch they are turned into the
play-ground for an hour on the parallel bars
and the other apparatus. At five they are collected
in the mission rooms, where their preparation
for the next day is supervised by volunteer
teachers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. De Peyster evidently uses the word “religious
proselytism” in the French, not the English,
sense. The French word “proselyte” is
nearly equivalent to the English “convert.” That
the <cite>Ecoles de Garde</cite> of the McAll Mission do
have a religious motive goes without saying.
About ten minutes of religious instruction are
given daily, but absolutely without proselyting
intent. Most of the parents of these children
are free thinkers or violently opposed to religion,
a few are Roman Catholics, but never a
word is said which could mar the influence of
any religiously disposed parent. As for the
others, the widely established fact that more children
from the McAll <cite>Ecoles de Garde</cite> pass their
examinations than any others makes even anti-religious
parents eager to have their children
attend them. For in France the whole future
of every child depends upon his school examinations.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE NEW PUBLICITY</h3>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>To the Editor</span>:</p>

<p class='c005'>In a recent book review of a modern novel,
the writer speaks of “episodes which violate the
reserve that is bred in the bone of the English-speaking
peoples.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is a serious matter, to my mind, that that reserve
is being deliberately violated by a number
of well-meaning people at this time in the campaign
that is being carried on against certain
diseases.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is necessary,” these people say, “to speak
plainly. Great harm has been wrought by ignorance.
The innocence of the child has been its
weakness. Under plea of modesty fathers and
mothers have been foolish and cowardly,” and
so on. You hear and see it everywhere, and lectures
are being delivered, to mixed audiences, on
things which, the apostle said, it was a shame
even to speak of.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now I believe that the necessary information
can, and should be, given to children from
twelve to fifteen; but it is my positive belief that
it should be done by the parents, or else by the
use of carefully prepared printed matter. A
short, modestly written pamphlet can tell all that
is necessary. It can be placed in the hands of
the child with instruction that it should be <i>read
and destroyed</i>; also that the parent will give any
further information required. I believe that oral
instruction on these matters, <i>to more than one
child present at a time</i>, is bad and harmful.</p>

<p class='c005'>I feel deeply in the matter, for I feel that
harm is being done when a strong, fine, racial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>trait is being violated, in attempting a good work
that can be <i>better</i> done, in my opinion, when it is
done in harmony with our best traditions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Attempts at allegory, comparisons with plant
life, and so on, are all best left aside. The child
should be told what is right and what is wrong,
and why. But it should not be told in company
with others, and especially not in mixed audiences.
The inbred reserve spoken of is too precious
a possession to be thrown away, even in a good
cause.</p>

<p class='c005'>Something of the same purport may be said
of the social evil now so freely discussed in the
press and forming so large a part of the subjects
written about in your issue of March 8. “Frankness”
and “freedom” are excellent, but some
things are too fine to be tarnished by careless use,
and modesty is one of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Where we are getting to in this new movement
to tear away the veil that has screened the family
life of America can be seen in some of the new
fiction. For instance, in Arnold Bennett’s Carlotta
the hectic heroine thinks that truth demands
that one should follow the dictates of animal instinct!</p>

<p class='c005'>The logical result will be that morality, either
ethical or religious, will be sent to the waste
basket.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION</h3>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>To the Editor</span>:</p>

<p class='c005'>In the March 8 issue of <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> there appeared
an article by Paul Kennaday, entitled
Big Business and Workmen’s Compensation.
This article is full of inaccurate statements and
should never, in justice to your readers, have
been printed.</p>

<p class='c005'>On page 809, in the first column, it is stated:
“Seized upon with alacrity by reformers, fought
at first at every step by the casualty insurance
companies and employers, ‘elective’ acts are now
cherished like a prodigal son,” etc. This statement
is unqualifiedly untrue. Employers generally
have been notoriously in favor of elective compensation
laws. Of course, they have been far
from unanimous, and their expert advisers have
generally been in favor of compulsory laws, but
anyone familiar with the attitude of employers in
the movement for compensation can bear witness
to the fact that the majority of employers have
throughout entertained a preference for elective
laws. On the other hand, the casualty insurance
companies have not fought such laws, nor have
they generally specifically favored them. There
has been as much difference of opinion among the
insurance men on this question as there has
been among all other classes of people. But in
general the representatives of the casualty insurance
companies have favored any kind of a
law which would substitute the liability for compensation
in place of the liability for negligence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course, the casualty insurance companies
have objected to such elective compensation laws
as the Ohio Act of 1911, for the reason that that
act gave the state insurance office a monopoly of
the compensation insurance. That left the casualty
companies to deal with the old negligence
liability with all its abuses and consequent unpopularity,
while it gave them no opportunity to
demonstrate their ability to administer compensation
insurance better than the State Office and
without the abuses incident to negligence insurance.</p>

<p class='c005'>The statement on page 809 at the bottom of
the first column and the top of the second, that
the “club” features of the elective compensation
law has a peculiar advantage from the casualty
companies’ standpoint is also diametrically the
opposite of the truth. What the casualty insurance
companies most desire is that the compensation
law shall be so framed as to induce all
employers, or all large employers, pretty unanimously
to adopt one course or the other; that is,
en masse to elect the compensation features of
the law, or, en masse to reject them. Otherwise
the casualty companies have to do business
under two different laws, providing for two different
kinds of insurance, the consequent of
which is to duplicate the work and a large part
of the expenses of the insurance companies.
They naturally do not want a law which will
cause employers to jump back and forth from
the compensation features to the negligence features
and vice versa, and experiment, but rather
one which will induce all to come permanently under
the compensation features or to stay out
permanently.</p>

<p class='c005'>On page 809, in the second column, it is
stated, referring to casualty companies: “With
equal determination they stop, where they can,
laws which give the employer no election, but
compel him to insure.” That is a purely gratuitous
misstatement of the facts. The casualty
companies have not—whatever some few exceptional
representatives of some companies may
have done—tried to stop the enactment of compulsory
compensation laws. They have, on the
other hand, opposed the enactment of so-called
compensation laws which would give a monopoly
of the insurance business to political boards. In
so doing they have adopted the natural attitude
of protecting their own business; and have done
no more than would the persons engaged in any
other business if it were proposed to transfer
their business to politicians.</p>

<p class='c005'>On page 809 in the same column, it is stated:
“Prospective annual profits in enormous amounts
are at stake for the casualty insurance companies
in this fight.” That statement is a pure figment
of the imagination. The writer cannot point out
anywhere on this earth where casualty insurance
companies have made profits in enormous
amounts. What is at stake for the casualty insurance
companies is the total value of the machinery
and good will of their business, which
ill-advised enthusiasts, under the secret guidance
of Socialist agitators, are trying to destroy.
But more important, the employes of such companies
have their bread and butter at stake; it
being proposed to transfer their jobs to political
appointees and to leave them out in the cold.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Lower down in the column it is stated that
“casualty insurance companies are to be found
advising, wherever workmen’s compensation is
under discussion.” As a matter of fact, the
casualty insurance companies have been very
reluctant about advising except when called upon;
but their actuaries have been in constant
demand, and naturally should be, since they are
about the only persons except the officials of
the state insurance departments, who know anything
about the business and the subject matter
involved. The further statement that “At meetings
of bar associations their attorneys have
resolutions passed deprecating state insurance” is
a gratuitous insult. No attorney for an insurance
company would offer a resolution at a meeting
of any bar association affecting the interests
of his clients without stating that fact; and thereupon
the resolution would be considered on its
merits and would express the opinions of the
members of the bar unaffected by the interests
of the casualty insurance companies.</p>

<p class='c005'>On page 810, in the first column, it is argued
that no doubt big business and the insurance
companies would be glad to see the pending constitutional
amendment defeated. That is a pure
assumption. Inasmuch as said amendment goes
infinitely farther than authorizing a compensation
law, and generally repeals the Bill of Rights
in application to the relation of employer and
employe, there may be many conservative opinions
opposed to its enactment. But big business,
the casualty insurance companies and a host of
conservative people have been most active in the
movement for an amendment permitting the enactment
of a compensation law in this state in
such form as the judgment of the legislature
might decide, without any restrictions in the interests
of any party.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the same page, near the top of the second
column, it is objected to the insurance committee’s
compensation bill now pending in the Legislature
that it leaves the function of fixing rates
in the State Insurance Department. Why not!
Is the objection to that provision that the Insurance
Department, being already constituted and
being composed of officials expert in the subject
of insurance, will fix rates properly and not use
state-administered insurance as a political
weapon? Why create a new body to deal with
the technical subjects with which the Insurance
Department is qualified to deal?</p>

<p class='c005'>Further down it is stated, sneeringly, that
“three constitutional objections to one bill is good
measure.” The objections are then stated. Now
as a matter of fact three constitutional objections
to one bill don’t amount to much unless these objections
are valid. All the objections recited in
this paragraph have been carefully considered
and the overwhelming weight of opinion is that
they are not valid.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is then stated that a certain change in this
bill from its earlier form has “in effect, turned
the whole rich New York field over to the casualty
companies.” And the reason for that conclusion
is stated to be that the employers will
do nothing until the casualty companies’ agents
come to them, and will then do what the casualty
insurance agents advise. That is nonsense.
When the casualty insurance agents go to the
employers under a law such as is proposed in
this bill, they will go with a proposition involving
an extremely large increase in rates. Employers
throughout this state have been aroused
over the subject of compensation and have studied
the question of insurance sufficiently to turn out
en masse against a proposition to give a state office
the monopoly of insurance. Does it seem
probable that when they are approached by the
casualty insurance companies’ agents they will
suddenly turn into fools and in effect submit to
a monopoly by those companies? On the contrary,
they will study the problem of mutual insurance
very hard, and there will undoubtedly
result many experiments in that line. Large
establishments also will study out the problem
of carrying their own insurance. It is also probable
that a few employers may venture to experiment
with state insurance. But the fact is, as
the writer of this article knows, that no well informed
and substantial employer will have anything
to do with state insurance except as a
last resource, or unless he is compelled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally it is stated that no spokesman for the
casualty insurance companies appears upon the
field in New York. That is rather ridiculous.
Officially, the two best informed persons upon
casualty insurance in this state should be Mr.
Hotchkiss, the former, and Mr. Emmet, the present,
state insurance commissioner; and they
both have spoken for, although not as the representatives
of, the casualty companies of New
York. At the same time, Frank E. Law, of the
Fidelity and Casualty Company, and Edson S.
Lott, of the United States Casualty Company,
have made many addresses and published a considerable
amount of literature on this subject.
Naturally, the insurance companies have sought
to avoid anything that would cause the false impression
that any bill was in their particular interest.
They have therefore rather confined
themselves to opposing thoroughly bad measures
than to advocating anything that they particularly
desire or recommend.</p>

<p class='c005'>The whole animus of this article is clearly betrayed
in the opening words of the last paragraph,
where the writer says, “while men are
deliberately and openly planning the utter rout
of the casualty companies....” Who are
these men that are deliberately and openly planning
the utter rout of the casualty companies?
The writer is among them. They are those who
seek to destroy private business in all its forms
and to substitute state management and control
in its place. Their activities in the present campaign
have nothing to do with the particular
merits or demerits of the compensation measures
in question. Their whole attitude is false,
in that they do not admit their motives, and besides
wantonly misstate facts as to their adversaries.</p>

<p class='c005'>After all, the discussion of State Funds to
Mothers has not left us breathless. Even after
the clear statements of two opposing social points
of view in <span class='sc'>The Survey</span> of March 1, and the summing
up by Dr. Devine it seems to me that there
still remains another point of view—that of the
mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>Speeches in a Mother’s Congress do not always
give the right idea of the mother’s point of view.
One must make allowance for fervour. A speaker
of charm and imagination will be quoted, but
the great body of mothers are as calm and collected
in thinking on this subject as on any other
domestic problem which comes to them for solution.
For there is no doubt that the women,
and above all, the mothers, will have something
to do and say about the solution of this problem.</p>

<p class='c005'>I belong to the class of mothers who would
not usually speak in public except for an accident.
The accident was that I discovered a
woman trying to do the impossible and found
that society seemed organized to ignore her.
She was not very good, but she was not bad.
No one tried to help her to be better. They said
they had been observing her, and that they were
not satisfied. She was a widow of thirty-five
with eight children under the working age. The
conditions under which that woman was struggling
were absolutely impossible and I broke the
boycott. Since then I have been interested in
mothers with minor dependent children.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seems to me that taking away the children
from a mother, is like taking away her life, for
the connection is so close and subtle. Many a
mother would prefer a quick and sudden death
to that slow and living one. It is like giving
capital punishment for a trivial offense. Sometimes
the offense is unintentional. It may be
poverty.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a certain temporary relief gained,
when children have been entirely dependent on
the mother, and she has had no bread to give
them. At first, when the relieving officer takes
the children and she knows that at night they
will be snug and warm and in the morning dressed
and fed, there is a great wave of thankfulness
and relief. But soon the mother asks herself,
“why could not I have warmed and fed and
dressed them, since I could have done it for
less?” Even the simplest mothers have heard
the whisper now. In their desperate loneliness
they are gathering, by tens and by thousands,
to ask for the custody of their own children.</p>

<p class='c005'>This social revolution may be like the French
revolution, but it is surely not like the burning
of witches, unless the witches are the ones that
stand by the cradles of neglected childhood.</p>

<p class='c005'>How carefully Miss Richmond, appealing to
our judgment and sound sense, figures out the
seemingly fabulous sums that might have been
saved to fight tuberculosis and feeble-mindedness,
from the sums wasted in soldiers pensions.
But why, I ask, is the whole country spell-bound,
helpless and hopeless at the prospect of the
mounting pension ladder? If we admit that the
granting of pensions to disabled soldiers was
right, why attack the principle instead of the
abuse of the practise? Surely that could be
helped. If a thing can be proven to be wrong
and illogical by mathematics, as Miss Richmond
has proved it to be, then it can be solved by
mathematics. There is a leak somewhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the same way, if there are more children
with their mothers, after a certain law has been
passed, and at the same time more in the institutions,
it shows, surely, that the attention of the
community has been called to a lot of children
unknown before or that someone has blundered
in counting them. A new law does not produce
a spontaneous crop of children, under the Juvenile
Court limit. Where were those children?
These are the things that a mother naturally
asks. They say that the soldiers are dying out.
But unless the risks and dangers and lack of
independence of the life deter women in the
future, there will always be mothers.</p>

<p class='c005'>But will there always be poor mothers? Have
we not begun a war on poverty?</p>

<p class='c005'>Why is not the prevention and cure of poverty
as wide and noble a field as the cure of tuberculosis?
Are we not studying to eliminate it in the
same way by destroying its breeding places, by
rescuing the child, by no longer considering poverty
as “the curse of God?” Poverty and tuberculosis
and other dark shapes go hand in hand.
Why is not the prevention of needless poverty
also a constructive health measure?</p>

<p class='c005'>And why, if we are to be so very careful and
scientific about it, is the question of non-support
always confused with that of the death of the
wage-earner? The man cannot take his responsibilities
with him into the next life, whatever
we say, and the poor cannot carry adequate insurance
till we copy England or Germany.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us have “more individualized, more skillful,
more thorough treatment of the widely diversified
causes of dependence” by all means.
But let us not forget that the fact of bearing
and rearing a child in itself creates a certain,
if variable, state of dependence for a woman.
No amount of learned reasoning can change the
fundamental fact that while the child is coming
into the world and is young the mother must
forfeit a certain amount of her independence to
care for the child. What I do not have patience
with is the preaching of that good old-fashioned
dogma “the mother’s best place is in the home.”
Nothing can be more valuable to the state than
the mother’s contribution, but the home has no
safeguards other than those which the man, with
his willing or unwilling hands can give her.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is the preachers and the social workers, I
have thought to myself many times who have
waked our sleeping “social conscience.” It may
be a good genie that is waked but it wants
something to do, and will not be put off with
promises.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Wilfred S. Reynolds, executive secretary
of the Cook County Board of Visitors
during its first year has succeeded Prof. Henry W.
Thurston and Dr. Hastings H. Hart as secretary
and superintendent of the Illinois Children’s
Home and Aid Society. A graduate of Earlham
College, Indiana, Mr. Reynolds was for six years
superintendent of schools and assistant superintendent
of the School for Delinquent Boys
at Plainfield, Ind. Under Amos W. Butler, he
was for four years in charge of the department
of the Indiana Board of State Charities for the
supervision of dependent and neglected children.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Illinois Children’s Home and Aid Society
is devoted to home-finding and the supervision
of children in foster homes, the aid and helpful
oversight of dependent parents with children,
and to the administration of the four institutions
conducted by the society in different parts
of the state of Illinois. A careful survey of
Chicago and of the state at large will soon be
undertaken by Mr. Reynolds and his staff to
determine anew the specific demands for the society’s
work and the scale upon which it can now
be undertaken. Its expenditures last year, as
reported by the subscriptions investigating committee
of the Chicago Association of Commerce,
were $62,616.</p>

<hr class='c018'>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c023'>The death of Samuel Allan Lattimore, Ph.D.,
LL.D., emeritus professor of chemistry of
the University of Rochester, at the age of
eighty-five, marks the passing of a notable educator
and social worker. Though born in the
central West of southern ancestry, he spent most
of his professional life in the East. He combined
in character the courtesy of the South,
the vigor of the West and the conservatism of
the East. He was a real aristocrat, the kind
that makes a true democrat. As a teacher, and
even as a friend, he gave the impression one has
in the Alps of distance without remoteness, of
aloofness without coldness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Lattimore’s reputation as a scientist was
such that in the face of bitter political opposition,
his report recommending the present source
of Rochester’s water supply was accepted. This
secured to the citizens an ideal water system. He
was one of the organizers of the Western New
York Institution for Deaf Mutes, of the Mechanics
Institute and of the Reynolds Library,
three of the most useful institutions of the city.
For several years he was a member of the city
Board of Health, of the Monroe County committee
of mental hygiene of the State Charities
Aid Association, and of the board of visitors for
that organization to the state hospital for the
insane. He was a pioneer advocate of cremation
on the ground of its sanitary value, and his body
was one of the first to be reduced to its elements
in the crematory just completed by his city.</p>

The community is as much his debtor as

but never would lower his professional
standards for commercial gain. One of his most
conspicuous early services was a course of free
public lectures on science given to large audiences
of working men for several successive
years in Buffalo, Cleveland and Rochester.</p>

<p class='c005'>Professor Lattimore’s mind was keenly alert
to the very end of his career and kept in touch
with all of the movements for social welfare.
Only a few days before his death he was deeply
interested in the article in a recent <span class='sc'>Survey</span> by

insurance field.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>At the summit of his usefulness Prince A.
Morrow has been gathered to his fathers.
Worn out by labor for a cause that possessed him
mind, body and estate, he was cut down in the
glory of what must almost be considered martyrdom.
His zeal for his endeavor engulfed him,
rendered him oblivious to all minor concerns.
He was happy in death because it occurred when
the tidal wave that he had started on its onward
course was sweeping a mighty current throughout
the length and breadth of the land.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Morrow was born December 19, 1846,
and therefore had not reached the allotted threescore
and ten years when death claimed him. He
was of gentle birth, and his mental equipment
and capacity entitled him to work as a peer
among intellectual men. His honesty of purpose,
strength of character, and mental courage rendered
him a fit champion for the cause he finally
espoused. At the age of eighteen, he won
his academic degree at Princeton College, Ky.
He took his professional degree from the Medical
Department of the University of New York
in 1874.</p>

<p class='c005'>His activity in professional work soon brought
him into prominence as a surgeon, lecturer, professor,
and author. He was an indefatigable
worker from the first, and a voluminous writer,
contributing essays freely to medical periodicals,
translating important works from the
French; he stood out as an authority on dermatology
and syphilology. Along these lines he
gained distinction and emolument.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this goal did not satisfy the cravings of
his moral nature. He had in him the sturdy
courage and the indomitable will of a reformer.
In his late manhood he set about the herculean
task of cleansing the moral atmosphere of the
community. He opened the door of publicity
and let in the light of knowledge upon the slimy
and festering course of the venereal diseases
in their ravaging march among the ignorant and
innocent.</p>

<p class='c005'>This led to a broadening of the lines of his
endeavor and the inclusion of the sex problem
in his crusade. More and more he recognized
the necessity of imparting correct information
upon sex matters to the budding curiosity of
youth and of giving honest food to clean young
minds, rather than the distorted nourishment
they had been wont to receive. His studies, his
writings, his teachings, and his special line of
practice and hospital work, all had served to
fit him peculiarly for his chosen task. The final
outcome of it all was the crowning glory of his
life, the formation of the Society of Sanitary
and Moral Prophylaxis, of which he was the
life and the soul and which above all else is
worthy of record among his achievements.</p>

<p class='c005'>After months of thought and much counsel
and consultation among his friends, who furnished
him scant support and at best only lukewarm
approval, he finally called a meeting on
February 8, 1905, at the New York Academy of
Medicine. A handful of men, twenty-five in all—timid,
half-hearted associates—gathered around
him to discuss the propriety of organizing a
society for “the study and prevention of the
spread of diseases which have their origin in the
social evil.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A movement of this nature was already under
way abroad, notably in France, Belgium, and
Germany, but England was nearly silent on the
subject and not a ripple of the current had
started on this side of the Atlantic. The medical
profession of New York was indifferent,
if not passively hostile, to the new movement,
while the country at large was apathetic. But
Dr. Morrow struggled in season and out of season
against indifference, opposition, and ridicule.
From this small beginning he pushed
ahead, until death snatched his tired body from
the arena. Yet his accomplishment lives and is
his monument—and practically his alone—for
he was its life and its spirit.</p>

<p class='c005'>Today the society in numbers approaches 2,000
and embraces in its membership individuals in
every quarter of the globe—Canada, England,
Scotland, Mexico, Asia, Africa, New Zealand.
Largely from the seed sown by the pioneer society,
there have sprung up in the United States
over twenty kindred bodies, most of which were
helped in organization by the literature of the
New York society and the kindly counsel and
encouragement of Dr. Morrow. The laity even
more than the profession, and notably women,
have put their shoulders to the wheel and assisted.
The press is no longer timidly hostile,
but opens its columns and lends its editorials to
spreading the idea which is now slowly sweeping
over the land.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Morrow has been recognized as the general
at the head of the advancing army, a recognition
which may be epitomized by quoting the
words of a resolution passed by the International
Congress of Hygiene and Demography at
Washington, September 27, 1912:</p>

<p class='c024'>Be it resolved: That the participants of
this section on sex hygiene of the Fifteenth
International Congress of Hygiene and
Demography, consider it a privilege to make
public record of their sense of obligation to
Dr. Morrow for his courageous and unflinching
attitude in the fact of difficulties

<p class='c005'>Dr. Morrow’s gracious manner and courtly
dignity, the balanced charm of his cultured and
deliberate diction, a combination that quite justifies
the seeming pretension of his praenomen—these

by those who have the honor to believe
that they may be classed among the number
of his friends.</p>

Prof. Charles E. Merriam of the University
of Chicago was again elected alderman
of his ward on April 1. The circumstances of
the victory give it unusual significance. All Chicago
watched the struggle so closely as almost to
forget the aldermanic battles in other wards. The
way in which he took up the cudgels shows
again Professor Merriam’s high degree of civic
courage. For scarcely a man who had served
with distinction as an alderman and then as the
leader in a mayoralty campaign that attracted
the nation’s attention, would have entered an
aldermanic fight again with the odds against him.
His ward, the boundaries of which were recently
changed, no longer includes the university as
it did when he was previously elected alderman.
It now stretches far to the south, and takes in
some industrial sections. Professor Merriam not
only had an able opponent but, in making non-partisanship
a main issue, he decided to run
solely as an independent candidate nominated
by petition.</p>

<p class='c005'>His opponents all ran on party tickets. There
was even a candidate under the Progressive
Party designation despite Professor Merriam’s
prominent identification with that party during
the last presidential campaign. The progressives
in Chicago tried hard to arrange an agreement
between all the parties to abandon party names
and leave the field throughout the city clear for
nominations solely by petition. When this failed
they nominated their own candidates. The candidacy
of a “progressive” against Professor Merriam
is said by some to have been part of a
scheme to beat him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Professor Merriam has aggressively worked
for public rights and welfare and the newer
methods of bringing the control of government
back to the people. His election is a triumph
for this type of public service as distinguished
from the “business administration” type which
his chief opponent personified.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>LEADERS IN THE MONTH’S MAGAZINES</h3>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Why Children Work.</span> By Helen M. Todd. <cite>McClure’s.</cite>
The answers of eight hundred of the little workers
who were questioned by Miss Todd as factory inspector
in Chicago. A little less than half the Chicago
children gave their father’s illness or death by industrial
accident or disease as the reason. An almost
equal number said they liked work better than school,
and their reasons, as given by Miss Todd, constitute
a pretty serious criticism of our educational system.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Safety by Sanction.</span> By John Anson Ford. <cite>Technical
World Magazine.</cite> Tells of the “safety first” campaign
set on foot by R. C. Richards, claim agent of the
Chicago and North Western Railroad, which, in less
than two years, has resulted in saving the life of one
trainman out of every two who under former conditions
would have been killed under the cars; saving similarly
one out of every three of the trackmen formerly doomed
to death in the performance of duty; reducing the
accident toll among passengers by 152 more passengers
saved from death and almost 5,000 more spared from
injury than the year before.</p>

<p class='c025'>This novel and enlightened effort to reduce claims
by preventing accidents has now spread to forty-six
railroads operating 60 per cent of the railroad mileage
in the United States.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The Fire Insurance Trap.</span> By William B. Ellison.
<cite>Pearson’s.</cite> As the expert chosen by Governor Sulzer
to frame a new form of the insurance policy for New
York, Mr. Ellison tells of the sixteen “teeth” by which
policy-holders can be caught at the present time.
These teeth are clauses in the policy by which the
companies can escape from their liability.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>A University That Runs a State</span>, by Frank Parker
Stockbridge, and</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>What I am Trying To Do</span>, by Adolph O. Eberhardt.
Both in the <cite>World’s Work</cite>. In Wisconsin,
the university “writes many of its laws, directs
much of its public service, increases its crops,
makes better farmers and housekeepers, conducts correspondence
schools, and carries a college education to
the door of every citizen who wants it.” In Minnesota
a governor who writes of his own plans, is trying
to keep farmers on their farms, by using a generous
state educational fund, with further grants by the
Legislature, to make the country school houses centers
for social intercourse for recreation and for practical
instruction in agriculture and household economics.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Consumers’ Co-operation</span>, by Albert Sonnichsen, and
<span class='sc'>Co-operation in Wisconsin</span>, by Robert A. Campbell.
Both in the <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>. A résumé by the
secretary of the co-operative league of the progress of
the co-operative movement in Europe and America,
supplemented by the intensive study of one state by
an official of the State Board of Public Affairs, created
last year with instruction, to make a special study of
the state experience in this field.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Industrial Peace and War.</span> By Everett P. Wheeler.
<cite>Atlantic Monthly.</cite> A plea for a compulsory arbitral
tribunal, which would substitute continual peace for
recurrent warfare in the relations of labor and capital.
Mr. Wheeler does not believe such a method of settling
labor disputes would be impracticable or unsuited to
American conditions or that the compulsory powers
of such a tribunal should be any more repugnant to
our ideas of liberty than is the power of our courts
to decide disputes between individuals.</p>

A. Rumball, in collaboration with Catherine
Rumball, of the facts in regard to the working
girls and women of that city who numbered at
the 1900 census about 19,000, or over 31 per
cent of all the women of Rochester. The facts
are for the most part taken from the last census

<p class='c006'>“Because you get paid for what you do in a
factory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because it’s easier to work in a factory than
’tis to learn in school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You never understands what they tells you
in school, and you can learn right off to do
things in a factory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They ain’t always pickin’ on you because you
don’t know things in a factory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t never do t’ings right in school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The boss he never hits yer, er slaps yer face,
er pulls yer ears, er makes yer stay in at recess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The children don’t holler at ye and call ye a
Christ-killer in a factory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They don’t call ye a Dago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re good to you at home when you earn

<p class='c007'>“You can give your mother yer pay envelope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our boss he never went to school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“School ain’t no good. The Holy Father he

<hr class='c030'>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c023'>Running the Home, by Martha Bensley
Bruère in <cite>Good Housekeeping</cite>, is an argument
for the use of public utilities in place of
certain old-fashioned forms of “elbow grease,”
on the ground not merely of the saving of labor
but of expense. Mrs. Bruère’s conclusion is
that the city, with its superior facilities for using
centralized facilities for heating, lighting, etc.,
co-operatively, comes out far ahead of the country.
In the budgets she studied the percentage
of income spent for the “operation of
the household—heat, light, repairs, services, etc.”—in
the city was only half what it is in the
country.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c023'>In Parenthood and the Social Conscience,
Seth K. Humphrey (<cite>Forum</cite>) recommends
the lifting of the burden of the hereditary defective
from society by “parenthood laws” which
would not force sterilization on defectives but
would give them the choice of sterilization or
segregation. The much controverted Indiana
institutional experience is the basis of Mr. Humphrey’s
conclusion that many defectives will accept
the former method of “ending their miseries
with themselves.”</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Frank Barclay Copley in an article
in the <cite>American Magazine</cite>, which receives
the commendation of Frederick W. Taylor in an
introductory note, thus defines the position of
the new science of management toward trade
unionism:</p>

<p class='c024'>“The only way the workers, herded into
gangs and treated as machines for grinding
out dividends, can defend themselves
is through organization. Ordinary unionism,
therefore, finds its justification as a
war-measure. Scientific management, however,
by establishing that community of interest
between capital and labor which has
so long been obscured by ignorance, creates
industrial peace, and the only persons who
have reason to oppose it are those who have
a personal interest in the continuance of
warfare. Under scientific management the
workers are not subordinates, but coordinates,
and each individual is free to earn,
learn, and rise as the Almighty has given
him the power. No form of collective bargaining
would seem to be called for, because
tasks are set and wages fixed, not by
arbitrary action, but by knowledge. The
only real boss, in fact, is knowledge; and if
anyone can speak with knowledge, he will
be listened to, and he will have his reward.
On the other hand, the tongue of ignorance
must be still; and so it follows that to the
extent that unionism means the placing of
ignorant men in the saddle, or to the extent
that it involves high labor costs, to that extent
must scientific management always be
against it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As an indication of those interferences with
shop administration which, with the growth of
scientific management, the unions will be called
upon to abandon, the passage is significant. But
progressive labor men will fail to find in it
any glimmer of understanding on the part of
the scientific managers of the larger democratic
safeguards of unionism. Who, for example, is
to set the base rates from which the wages of
any given line of craftsmen are to be scientifically
built up and calculated?</p>

Delta on November 6 and initiated a scheme
for the distribution of land which has become
available for cultivation through drainage.
As an experiment, 610 feddans (or
acres) were distributed in five-feddan lots
to the landless fellaheen (peasants), the
idea being to help the poor fellaheen and at
the same time to increase the number of
small landholders and to create family homesteads.
During the first three years, when
they must do work of reclamation, the
fellaheen will receive the land practically
free, and in the following ten years they will
pay a moderate rental, after which the holding
becomes theirs for life. Afterward the
land descends in the families if the government
approves. Alienation is forbidden, except
with the consent of the State.”</p>
